# React2Shell: Critical Next.js Vulnerability You Need to Patch Now

A critical security vulnerability called **React2Shell** (CVE-2025-55182) has been discovered in React Server Components, affecting Next.js versions 15 through 16. If you're running a Next.js application in production, you need to check your version and patch immediately.

This isn't a theoretical risk—the vulnerability allows **remote code execution** through specially crafted requests. Your servers could be compromised.

**What you'll learn:**
- What React2Shell is and why it's critical
- How to check if your application is affected
- Step-by-step remediation guide
- Additional security measures to implement

**Time to read:** 5 minutes
**Urgency:** High - patch immediately if affected

## What Is React2Shell?

React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) is a critical vulnerability in React Server Components that enables remote code execution (RCE) under specific conditions. Attackers can send specially crafted requests that bypass intended security boundaries, potentially gaining full control of your server.

### Why This Is Serious

Remote code execution is one of the most severe vulnerability types. An attacker exploiting React2Shell could:

- **Execute arbitrary commands** on your server
- **Access environment variables** including API keys and database credentials
- **Read and modify files** on your system
- **Pivot to other systems** in your infrastructure
- **Exfiltrate sensitive data** from your application

The vulnerability affects React Server Components broadly, meaning any framework using them could be at risk.

## Affected Versions

| Framework | Affected Versions |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Next.js | 15.0.0 through 16.0.6 |
| Next.js Canaries | 14.3.0-canary.76 and later |

The following packages are also affected:
- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

**Safe versions:** Next.js 15.3.6+ and 16.0.7+

## How to Check If You're Affected

### Method 1: Browser Console

Load your application and open the browser developer tools. In the console, run:

```javascript
next.version
```

This will output your Next.js version.

### Method 2: Check package.json

Look at your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "15.2.3"  // Check this version
  }
}
```

If your version falls within the affected range (15.0.0 - 16.0.6), you need to patch immediately.

### Method 3: Vercel Dashboard

If you're deployed on Vercel, check your dashboard. Affected production deployments will display a **warning banner** alerting you to the vulnerability.

### Method 4: CLI Check

Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npm list next
```

Or for yarn:

```bash
yarn why next
```

## Remediation Steps

### Step 1: Upgrade Next.js

The fastest fix is upgrading to a patched version.

**Using npm:**

```bash
npm install next@15.3.6
```

**Using yarn:**

```bash
yarn add next@15.3.6
```

**Using the automated fix tool:**

```bash
npx fix-react2shell-next
```

This tool automatically updates your Next.js version and related dependencies.

### Step 2: Test Your Application

Before deploying, verify your application works correctly:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Run your test suite to catch any breaking changes:

```bash
npm test
```

### Step 3: Deploy Immediately

Once tests pass, deploy to production as soon as possible:

```bash
# For Vercel
vercel --prod

# For other platforms
npm run build && npm run deploy
```

Every minute your unpatched application is live is a window for potential exploitation.

### Step 4: Rotate All Secrets

**This step is critical.** If your application was exposed while vulnerable, assume your secrets may have been compromised:

1. **Rotate API keys** - regenerate all third-party API keys
2. **Change database credentials** - update database passwords
3. **Rotate JWT secrets** - invalidate existing tokens
4. **Update OAuth credentials** - regenerate client secrets
5. **Change encryption keys** - if you use custom encryption

Update your environment variables in all environments (development, staging, production).

### Step 5: Audit Access Logs

Review your server logs for suspicious activity:

- Unusual POST requests to Server Component endpoints
- Unexpected function timeouts
- Error patterns indicating exploitation attempts
- Requests from unexpected IP ranges

## Additional Security Measures

### Enable Vercel WAF Rules

If you're on Vercel, enable Web Application Firewall rules. Vercel has deployed specific rules to detect and block known React2Shell exploit patterns.

### Review Shareable Links

Audit any preview deployment links you've shared. These could have been exposed to the vulnerability as well.

### Enable Standard Protection

For non-production deployments, enable Vercel's Standard Protection to add an extra layer of security.

### Monitor for Indicators of Compromise

Set up alerts for:

- New user accounts you didn't create
- Unexpected outbound network connections
- Modified files in your deployment
- Unusual resource usage patterns

## Conclusion

React2Shell is a serious vulnerability that requires immediate action. Don't delay patching—the exploitation risk is real and the fix is straightforward.

**Key takeaways:**
- Upgrade to Next.js 15.3.6+ or 16.0.7+ immediately
- Rotate all application secrets after patching
- Monitor logs for signs of exploitation
- Enable additional security measures like WAF rules

### What's Next?

1. **Check your version right now** - don't finish this article first
2. **Patch and deploy** within the hour if you're affected
3. **Rotate secrets** even if you're unsure about exposure
4. **Share this with your team** - they may have affected projects too
