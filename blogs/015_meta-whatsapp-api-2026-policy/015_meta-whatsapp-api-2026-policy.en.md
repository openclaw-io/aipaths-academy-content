# WhatsApp Business API: Meta's 2026 Policy Changes Explained

Meta just made one of its most controversial moves yet: banning general-purpose AI chatbots from WhatsApp while positioning Meta AI as the platform's exclusive assistant. With antitrust investigations now open in the EU, Italy, and Brazil, here's everything you need to know.

**What you'll learn:**
- Which AI chatbots are banned and which remain allowed
- The antitrust battles unfolding across multiple countries
- New pricing changes affecting your WhatsApp Business costs
- Timeline of key events and what comes next

## General-Purpose AI Chatbot Ban

### What Happened

Meta changed its WhatsApp Business API terms to ban general-purpose AI chatbots from the platform. The policy already applies to new users since October 15, 2025, and rolls out to all existing users on **January 15, 2026**.

### Who's Affected

- OpenAI (ChatGPT on WhatsApp)
- Perplexity
- Luzia (Khosla Ventures-backed)
- Poke (General Catalyst-backed)
- Any AI offering open-ended, assistant-style conversations

### What's Still Allowed

- Customer support bots
- Order tracking and notifications
- Booking systems
- FAQ bots
- Sales chatbots with structured flows

### Why Meta Did This

1. **Infrastructure strain**: Open-ended AI conversations generated massive message volumes
2. **Monetization gap**: AI bots didn't fit WhatsApp's template-based billing categories
3. **Strategic positioning**: Clears the path for Meta AI as the only general-purpose assistant on WhatsApp

## Antitrust Investigations

Multiple countries are now investigating Meta's policy changes. Here's where things stand:

| Country/Region | Status | Action Taken |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| **European Union** | Formal investigation opened | Assessing if Meta breached EU competition rules. Potential fine: up to **10% of global revenue** |
| **Italy** | Suspension ordered | AGCM found Meta's conduct "appears to constitute an abuse" limiting market access. Meta must suspend the policy in Italy |
| **Brazil** | Suspension ordered + investigation | CADE called the restriction "disproportionate" and a potential violation of free economic competition |

### Meta's Response

Meta called Italy's decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing WhatsApp's business API isn't a route to market for AI companies—app stores and websites are. Meta plans to appeal.

**Interesting exception:** Meta told AI providers they can continue operating in Italy even after January 15, 2026.

## New Pricing Model (January 1, 2026)

Meta shifted from **conversation-based billing** to **per-message pricing** for template messages.

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Billing unit | Per message (not per 24-hour conversation) |
| Location-based pricing | Charged based on **recipient's country**, not sender's |
| Currency expansion | 16 currencies supported by end of 2026 |
| Local billing | India (Jan 2026), Brazil (H2 2026) |

### Regional Rate Changes

- **India**: Marketing rates **increased ~10%**
- **France & Egypt**: Marketing rates **decreased 28-40%**
- **North America**: Utility/Authentication rates **lowered**

## What's Now Free

| Message Type | Status | When |
|--------------|--------|------|
| Service conversations (user-initiated) | **Free** | Since November 1, 2024 |
| Utility templates within 24h window | **Free** | Since July 1, 2025 |
| Marketing templates | Always charged | — |
| Authentication templates | Always charged | — |

**Volume discounts:** High-volume senders of utility and authentication messages now get tiered discounts (since July 2025).

## Timeline of Key Events

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| July 2025 | Italy begins probe into Meta AI integration in WhatsApp |
| July 1, 2025 | Per-message pricing model launches |
| October 15, 2025 | AI chatbot ban applies to new WhatsApp Business API users |
| October 18, 2025 | TechCrunch breaks the chatbot ban story |
| November 2025 | EU opens formal antitrust investigation |
| December 24, 2025 | Italy orders Meta to suspend the policy |
| January 1, 2026 | New pricing rates take effect |
| January 13, 2026 | Brazil orders Meta to suspend + launches investigation |
| January 15, 2026 | AI chatbot ban enforced for all existing users |

## What This Means for Your Business

**If you have a business chatbot (support, sales, bookings):** You're fine. These remain fully allowed.

**If you built a general-purpose AI assistant on WhatsApp:** You need to pivot or exit the platform (unless you're in Italy or another jurisdiction that blocks enforcement).

**For costs:** Budget for per-message pricing. High-volume marketing senders in India will pay more; those targeting France/Egypt will pay less.

## Conclusion

Meta's WhatsApp policy changes represent a significant shift in how AI can operate on the platform. While business-focused chatbots remain unaffected, the ban on general-purpose AI assistants—combined with ongoing antitrust scrutiny—signals that the battle over AI distribution channels is just beginning.

**Key takeaways:**
- General-purpose AI chatbots are banned; business bots are safe
- EU, Italy, and Brazil are actively investigating Meta
- Per-message pricing is now live—adjust your budgets accordingly
