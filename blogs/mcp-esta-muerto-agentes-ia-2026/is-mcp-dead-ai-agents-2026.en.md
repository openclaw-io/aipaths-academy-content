Over the last few months, an uncomfortable phrase started appearing in the AI agent world: "MCP is dead."

The provocation makes sense. Many teams tried Model Context Protocol to connect agents with external tools and ran into the same problems: more processes running, more authentication, more initialization failures, permissions that were harder to audit, and, in some cases, more tokens spent describing tools the agent was not even going to use.

But turning that frustration into "MCP is dead" is too simplistic. What probably died is something else: the idea that every agent integration should start with MCP.

For an entrepreneur, technical founder, or small team, that distinction matters. You do not need to win a protocol war. You need to build automations that work, remain maintainable, and do not become fragile every time the fashionable tool changes.

## What MCP is and why it became so important

MCP, or Model Context Protocol, is an open standard for connecting AI applications with external systems: databases, files, SaaS tools, internal tools, APIs, and workflows. The promise is attractive: instead of creating different integrations for every model or client, you expose capabilities through a common protocol.

Anthropic introduced it in November 2024 as a way to replace fragmented integrations with an open standard. The official documentation compares it to a USB-C port for AI applications: a common way to connect models with data, tools, and context.

That framing explains the hype. If agents are going to work with GitHub, Slack, Notion, Postgres, Google Drive, Figma, CRMs, and internal tools, a common standard sounds inevitable.

Real adoption also does not point to a dead protocol. Claude Code supports it. OpenAI lets developers use connectors and remote MCP servers in the Responses API. Microsoft Copilot Studio lets teams extend agents with tools and resources published by MCP servers. The MCP project has a specification, SDKs, a preview registry, and an active conversation around remote servers.

So if MCP still shows up in large stacks, why are so many developers saying it is dying?

Because platform support is one thing. Being the best decision for every integration is another.

## What the criticism of MCP gets right

The Quandri article and Eric Holmes's original post are not just internet complaints. They capture real pain from teams that tried to use MCP in daily work.

The first pain was context. Quandri measured that the tool definitions from its MCP servers used more than 20,000 tokens when four servers were loaded. That was a heavy cost: before doing useful work, the model was already carrying full menus of tools.

That point has partly changed. Current Claude Code documentation explains that Tool Search defers tool definitions and only loads what Claude needs when it needs it. In other words, the "MCP eats context" argument was valid in many setups, but it should not be repeated as if the ecosystem had not reacted.

The second pain is still very alive: operational reliability. A local MCP server is another process. It has to start, authenticate, stay alive, handle permissions, and return results in a format the agent understands. When it fails, you cannot always reproduce the issue as easily as running a terminal command.

The third pain is overlap. Many tasks being wrapped in MCP already have a better interface: a CLI, an API, or a no-code workflow. If I want to check a GitHub issue, the GitHub CLI already exists. If I want to read a database, SQL already exists. If I want to trigger a stable business automation, n8n or a direct API may be more predictable.

There is also a fourth point we should not soften: security. In May 2026, the NSA published specific guidance on MCP and warned that, although MCP simplifies agent integrations, its security posture still depends heavily on implementation discipline. The risks include dynamic tool invocation, implicit trust relationships, shared context, incomplete access control, insufficient logs, and servers deployed without enough governance.

For a small business, that translates into something concrete: if you connect an agent to many tools with broad permissions, MCP does not magically save you. It can give you a standard interface, but you still need boundaries, logs, least-privilege permissions, and human approval for sensitive actions.

## What the criticism exaggerates

Saying MCP is dead confuses two levels.

At the protocol level, MCP is more alive than it was a year ago. Major platforms support it. Remote transports, registries, connectors, and active documentation exist. OpenAI even recommends connecting to official provider servers when possible and warns developers to be careful with aggregators or third-party servers. Microsoft is incorporating it into Copilot Studio as a way to add tools and resources to enterprise agents.

At the system design level, the criticism lands: MCP should not be the automatic default.

The right question is not "MCP or no MCP?" The right question is: "Does this task need an MCP server, or is there a simpler, more auditable, more stable interface?"

A protocol can be alive and still be the wrong decision for your use case.

## The practical framework: MCP, CLI, API, n8n, or skills

If you are building agents or automations for your business, use this baseline rule: choose the interface that reduces total friction, not the one that sounds more agentic.

### Use a direct API when the flow is stable and critical

If the workflow is repeatable, runs in production, and has clear rules, a direct API is usually better than MCP.

Examples: creating leads in a CRM, checking inventory, sending events to a backend, generating invoices, registering payments, syncing users, or updating internal states.

Why? Because you can control errors, retries, validations, logs, idempotency, and permissions in code. The agent does not need to improvise a tool call; your system already knows which action is allowed.

For business operations, this is often the most robust option.

### Use n8n when the process is operational and needs visibility

For small teams, n8n fits especially well when the flow combines business tools: Gmail, Airtable, WhatsApp, HubSpot, Slack, forms, webhooks, and human steps.

In those cases, MCP can be excessive. If the process is "when this form arrives, classify the lead, create a task, and notify the team on WhatsApp," n8n gives you something valuable: a visible diagram, deterministic nodes, retries, and control points.

The LLM can participate in one part of the flow, but it does not need to control the whole system.

### Use the CLI when the work is technical and must be debuggable

For development, infrastructure, and debugging tasks, the CLI has a huge advantage: humans and agents use the same interface.

If the agent runs `gh`, `psql`, `git`, `docker`, `npm`, `kubectl`, or `terraform`, you can reproduce what it did. You can copy the command, inspect the output, adjust flags, and review logs.

This is the strong thesis in Eric Holmes's post: the best tools are useful for humans and machines. In development, that idea matters a lot. If a good, authenticated CLI already exists, wrapping it in MCP may add a layer without adding enough value.

### Use skills when the problem is repeatable context

Many times you do not need a new tool. You need the agent to remember how to work inside your system.

That is where skills or versioned instructions help: procedures, checklists, common commands, review criteria, repository conventions, and deployment steps. Claude Code documents that a skill loads its body only when used, which makes it useful for repeatable processes without paying the context cost all the time.

Examples: "how to review a PR in this repo," "how to validate content before publishing," "how to run this stack locally," or "how to audit an n8n automation."

This does not replace an API or an MCP server. It replaces the habit of pasting the same instructions every week.

### Use MCP when you need a standard shared tool layer

MCP does have strong use cases.

Use it when the service does not have a good CLI, when you want to expose the same integration to several AI clients, when you need dynamic resources and tools, when the provider maintains an official remote server, or when a team needs centralized connector management.

It can also make sense for non-technical users. An operations team is not going to run `curl`, `jq`, or `gh` in a terminal. An MCP connector inside Claude, ChatGPT, or Copilot can give them access to capabilities without exposing them to a CLI.

The point is that MCP should earn its place. Not because it is fashionable. Because it actually reduces operational cost.

## The quick decision matrix

Before investing weeks into an MCP integration, answer these questions:

- Does a stable API already exist for this action?
- Does an official CLI already exist that the agent can use and a human can debug?
- Does the flow need a visual interface and human steps? If yes, look at n8n.
- Is this mostly a repeatable-instructions problem rather than a tooling problem? If yes, create a skill.
- Is the MCP server official from the provider or a third-party proxy?
- What real permissions will the agent have?
- What data leaves your environment through the MCP server?
- Are there logs for every tool call?
- Can you require approval for sensitive actions?
- What happens if the server changes tools, outputs, or scopes without warning?

If you cannot answer those questions, you do not have an architecture yet. You have hype with credentials.

## What an entrepreneur should do now

My recommendation for AIPaths is simple: do not bet your operation on a protocol. Design your agents in layers.

For stable business automations, use APIs and n8n. For technical work, favor CLIs and repositories with clear instructions. For repeatable operational knowledge, create skills. For shared connectors, tools without a good CLI, dynamic resources, or official integrations, evaluate MCP.

This combination avoids two common mistakes.

The first mistake is rejecting MCP completely because some developers had bad experiences. That can keep you away from a standard that will probably keep growing in enterprise tooling.

The second mistake is using MCP everywhere because it sounds modern. That can give you agents that are slower, more opaque, and harder to audit.

The advantage is choosing with judgment.

## Conclusion

MCP is not dead. What is dying is MCP as an automatic reflex.

The next stage of agents will not reward whoever connects the most tools. It will reward whoever builds systems that know when to use an API, when to use n8n, when to use a CLI, when to load a skill, and when MCP really adds a useful standard layer.

For founders and small teams, that is the practical decision: do not build around the protocol. Build around the outcome, maintainability, and control.

If MCP reduces real friction, use it. If it adds a layer nobody can debug, do not use it. And if the only reason to choose it is that it appears on every tool's landing page, you probably already have your answer.
