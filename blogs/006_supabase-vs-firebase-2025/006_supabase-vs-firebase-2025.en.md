# Supabase vs Firebase: Which Should You Choose in 2025?

The Backend-as-a-Service landscape in 2025 has two clear leaders: Google's Firebase and the open-source challenger Supabase. With Firebase launching vector search capabilities and multi-region improvements, and Supabase crossing 1.7 million developers with a $2 billion valuation, this choice matters more than ever.

I've shipped production apps on both platforms. Firebase felt like magic at first—authentication working in minutes, real-time sync with zero configuration. Then I hit the walls. I migrated to Supabase for my next project. The difference? **Firebase trades control for convenience. Supabase gives you both, but only if you know SQL.**

This isn't a theoretical feature list. This is what actually matters when you're building real applications with real users.

**What you'll learn:**
- Why SQL vs NoSQL matters more than you think
- Real pricing with actual usage scenarios (not just marketing numbers)
- When Firebase's magic becomes a limitation
- Why Supabase's open-source approach saves you from vendor lock-in
- Migration paths and their actual difficulty
- How both integrate with AI/ML workflows

**Time to read:** 18 minutes
**Skill level:** Intermediate

## Executive Summary: The Real Story

**Choose Supabase if:**
- You need structured data with complex relationships
- SQL familiarity is your superpower (or you want it to be)
- You value transparency and want to avoid vendor lock-in
- Predictable pricing matters ($25/month Pro vs Firebase's per-operation billing)
- You're building AI apps with vector embeddings
- Open-source and self-hosting options are important
- You want PostgreSQL's power (ACID compliance, full-text search, JSON)

**Choose Firebase if:**
- You need to prototype and ship extremely fast
- Your team is already deep in the Google/GCP ecosystem
- You're building mobile-first with Flutter or Swift
- NoSQL document structure fits your data model perfectly
- You need battle-tested scalability (used by Duolingo, Alibaba, The New York Times)
- Real-time sync is your primary requirement
- You prefer managed complexity over control

**The Reality:**
Many developers (including myself) **started with Firebase and migrated to Supabase** as their apps matured. Why? Because Firebase's convenience becomes constraint as requirements grow. But Firebase still dominates for certain use cases—and that's perfectly fine.

## My Journey: From Firebase Fanboy to Supabase Convert

### Why I Started with Firebase

**The Initial Experience:**
```javascript
// This literally worked on first try
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getAuth, signInWithPopup, GoogleAuthProvider } from 'firebase/auth';

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);

// Google login in 3 lines
const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
signInWithPopup(auth, provider).then((result) => {
  console.log('Logged in!', result.user);
});
```

**What I Loved:**
- Authentication worked instantly—Google, email, phone, all out of the box
- Real-time database sync felt like magic
- Zero backend code to write
- Free tier was generous
- Documentation was excellent

**What I Built:**
- A fitness tracking app (perfect for Firestore's document model)
- A chat application (real-time was flawless)
- Several prototypes and MVPs

**The Growing Pains:**

Around month 3, I needed to:
- Join user data with activity records
- Generate analytics across multiple collections
- Implement complex permission logic

**Firebase's Response:**
- "Use Cloud Functions to aggregate data"
- "Denormalize your data" (copy it everywhere)
- "Security rules can't do that—use backend validation"

Suddenly I was writing backend code anyway, just in a more constrained environment.

### The Breaking Point

**The Moment Everything Changed:**

```javascript
// What I wanted to do:
SELECT users.name, activities.count, AVG(activities.score)
FROM users
JOIN activities ON users.id = activities.user_id
WHERE activities.date > '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY users.id
HAVING AVG(activities.score) > 7;

// What Firebase made me do:
// 1. Query all users
// 2. For each user, query their activities
// 3. Filter and aggregate in Cloud Functions
// 4. Hope it doesn't timeout
// 5. Pay for all those read operations
```

**The Real Cost:**
- 150,000 document reads for what should be one query
- $45 unexpected bill that month (was paying $0 before)
- Performance degraded as data grew
- Code became increasingly complex

**The Decision:**
I spent a weekend migrating to Supabase for my next project. Not because Firebase is bad, but because **I needed SQL**.

### Three Months with Supabase

**First Impressions:**

```typescript
// The same query, Supabase style
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select(`
    name,
    activities!inner(count, score)
  `)
  .gte('activities.date', '2025-01-01')
  .gte('activities.score.avg', 7);
```

**What Surprised Me:**
- PostgreSQL did in one query what took Firebase hundreds
- Row Level Security (RLS) was more powerful than Firebase security rules
- API calls were unlimited—pricing based on resources, not operations
- Real-time subscriptions worked just as well as Firebase
- I could literally `psql` into my database

**Current Setup:**
- Supabase Pro ($25/month)
- Three production applications
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for AI features
- Zero regrets

**The Difference:**
- Queries I can reason about
- Pricing I can predict
- Architecture I can trust
- Exit strategy if needed (it's just Postgres)

## Database Architecture: SQL vs NoSQL—Why It Matters

This is the fundamental difference. Everything else flows from this decision.

### Firebase: NoSQL Document Database

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Firestore: Collections of documents
users/
  ├── userId1/
  │   ├── name: "Alice"
  │   ├── email: "alice@example.com"
  │   └── preferences: {theme: "dark", lang: "en"}
  └── userId2/
      ├── name: "Bob"
      └── email: "bob@example.com"

activities/
  ├── actId1/
  │   ├── userId: "userId1"
  │   ├── type: "workout"
  │   └── duration: 45
  └── actId2/
      ├── userId: "userId1"
      └── type: "meditation"
```

**Strengths:**
- **Flexible schema**: Add fields anytime, no migrations
- **Natural nesting**: Perfect for hierarchical data
- **Horizontal scaling**: Google's infrastructure handles it
- **Document-oriented**: Each user profile is self-contained

**Limitations:**
- **No joins**: Can't efficiently query across collections
- **Denormalization required**: Copy data everywhere (users.name in every activity)
- **Query constraints**: Can't do complex filtering/aggregation
- **Transaction limits**: Max 500 documents per transaction

**Best For:**
- User profiles (self-contained documents)
- Chat messages (flat, append-only)
- Product catalogs (independent items)
- Activity feeds (chronological documents)

### Supabase: PostgreSQL Relational Database

**Data Structure:**
```sql
-- Supabase: Tables with relationships
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb
);

CREATE TABLE activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_user_id ON activities(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_created_at ON activities(created_at);
```

**Strengths:**
- **Powerful queries**: JOINs, aggregations, window functions
- **Data integrity**: Foreign keys, constraints, ACID compliance
- **No duplication**: Normalize data, query it efficiently
- **Advanced features**: Full-text search, geospatial, JSON, arrays
- **Transactions**: Complex multi-table operations safely

**Limitations:**
- **Schema required**: Must define structure upfront
- **Migrations needed**: Changing structure requires planning
- **SQL knowledge**: Learning curve if you're unfamiliar
- **Vertical scaling limits**: Single region performance ceiling (multi-region available)

**Best For:**
- E-commerce (products, orders, inventory with relationships)
- Social networks (users, posts, comments, likes with complex queries)
- SaaS applications (tenants, users, subscriptions with complex permissions)
- Analytics dashboards (aggregating across multiple dimensions)
- AI applications (vector embeddings with metadata filtering)

### The Real-World Impact

**Scenario: Building a Task Management App**

**Firebase Approach:**
```javascript
// Each task must duplicate user info for display
{
  taskId: "task1",
  title: "Deploy app",
  assignedTo: "userId1",
  assignedToName: "Alice",      // Duplicated
  assignedToAvatar: "url...",   // Duplicated
  createdBy: "userId2",
  createdByName: "Bob",         // Duplicated
  project: "projectId1",
  projectName: "Backend API",   // Duplicated
  status: "in_progress"
}

// When Alice changes her name:
// - Update the users collection
// - Find ALL tasks assigned to Alice
// - Update assignedToName in each
// - Hope no tasks got created during the update
```

**Supabase Approach:**
```sql
-- Clean, normalized structure
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  assigned_to UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
  status TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Query with current data (no duplication)
SELECT
  tasks.title,
  assigned.name as assigned_to_name,
  assigned.avatar as assigned_to_avatar,
  creator.name as created_by_name,
  projects.name as project_name
FROM tasks
JOIN users assigned ON tasks.assigned_to = assigned.id
JOIN users creator ON tasks.created_by = creator.id
JOIN projects ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
WHERE assigned.name = 'Alice';

-- When Alice changes her name:
-- - Update ONE row in users table
-- - All queries automatically show new name
```

**Winner:** Depends on your data model, but for relational data, SQL wins decisively.

## Authentication: Both Excellent, Different Styles

### Firebase Authentication

**Features:**
- Email/Password
- Phone (SMS/OTP)
- Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Apple, Microsoft
- Anonymous authentication
- Custom auth providers
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA)
- Email verification and password reset

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: First 50,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- **Phone Auth**: $0.01 per verification after 10k (costs from day 1 for production)
- **Beyond 50k MAU**: Auto-upgrade to Google Cloud Identity Platform

**Strengths:**
- Zero configuration for Google sign-in (obviously)
- Excellent mobile SDKs (Flutter, Swift, Kotlin)
- Automatic token refresh
- Built-in email templates
- Firebase Console UI for user management

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import { getAuth, signInWithEmailAndPassword } from 'firebase/auth';

const auth = getAuth();
signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)
  .then((userCredential) => {
    // Automatically sets auth token in headers
    const user = userCredential.user;
  });

// That's it. Firestore queries now respect auth.
```

### Supabase Authentication

**Features:**
- Email/Password
- Phone (SMS/OTP)
- OAuth (Google, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure, etc.)
- Magic links (passwordless email)
- Third-party auth providers
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Row Level Security (RLS) integration

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: 50,000 Monthly Active Users
- **Unlimited API requests** (not per-operation pricing)
- Pro: $25/month (100,000 MAU)

**Strengths:**
- **Row Level Security**: PostgreSQL policies enforce permissions at database level
- **Magic links**: Passwordless auth built-in
- **OpenID Connect**: Standard protocol, not proprietary
- **Self-hostable**: Run your own auth server
- **Admin API**: Programmatically manage users

**Code Example:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password,
});

// Row Level Security enforces permissions
// Users can only see their own data automatically
```

**RLS Example:**
```sql
-- This is POWERFUL
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view tasks assigned to them"
ON tasks FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = assigned_to);

CREATE POLICY "Project managers can view all project tasks"
ON tasks FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM project_members
    WHERE project_id = tasks.project_id
    AND user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'manager'
  )
);

-- No more client-side filtering, no Cloud Functions
-- Database enforces permissions automatically
```

### Authentication Winner: Draw (Both Excellent)

**Choose Firebase Auth if:**
- You need seamless Google ecosystem integration
- You're building mobile-first applications
- You want automatic token management without thinking

**Choose Supabase Auth if:**
- You want database-level permission enforcement (RLS)
- You need magic link / passwordless auth
- You prefer standard protocols (OpenID Connect)
- Self-hosting is a requirement

## Storage: Files, Images, and Media

### Firebase Storage

**Features:**
- Built on Google Cloud Storage
- Automatic image resizing (with extensions)
- CDN distribution globally
- Direct uploads from client
- Security rules for access control
- Firebase ML integration

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: 5GB storage, 1GB/day download
- **Blaze**: $0.026/GB stored, $0.12/GB downloaded
- Operations: $0.05 per 10k uploads, $0.004 per 10k downloads

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import { ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL } from 'firebase/storage';

const storage = getStorage();
const storageRef = ref(storage, `avatars/${userId}`);

await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);
const url = await getDownloadURL(storageRef);

// Security rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /avatars/{userId} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if request.auth != null
                   && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Supabase Storage

**Features:**
- S3-compatible storage
- Automatic image optimization/resizing
- CDN with caching
- Resumable uploads
- Public and private buckets
- RLS integration

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: 1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth
- **Pro**: 100GB storage + 200GB bandwidth ($25/month total)
- **Overage**: $0.021/GB stored, $0.09/GB bandwidth

**Code Example:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('avatars')
  .upload(`${userId}/avatar.png`, file);

// Get public URL
const { data: urlData } = supabase.storage
  .from('avatars')
  .getPublicUrl(`${userId}/avatar.png`);

// RLS for fine-grained control
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

**Image Transformation (Both Platforms):**
```typescript
// Supabase: On-the-fly image resizing
const { data } = supabase.storage
  .from('avatars')
  .getPublicUrl(`user1/avatar.png`, {
    transform: {
      width: 200,
      height: 200,
      resize: 'cover'
    }
  });

// Firebase: Using extensions or Cloud Functions
```

### Storage Winner: Firebase (Slightly)

**Why:** Firebase Storage's tight integration with Google Cloud's infrastructure and ML capabilities gives it a slight edge for complex media workflows. Supabase is catching up fast though.

## Functions: Serverless Backend Logic

### Firebase Cloud Functions

**Capabilities:**
- HTTP endpoints
- Firestore triggers (onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete)
- Auth triggers (onCreate, onDelete)
- Storage triggers
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Scheduled functions (cron)
- Multi-language support (Node.js, Python, Go, Java)

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: 2 million invocations/month
- **Blaze**: $0.40 per million invocations
- Compute time: $0.0000025/GB-second
- Networking costs apply

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Cloud Function triggered on user creation
import { onDocumentCreated } from 'firebase-functions/v2/firestore';

export const sendWelcomeEmail = onDocumentCreated('users/{userId}',
  async (event) => {
    const userData = event.data.data();

    // Send email
    await sendEmail({
      to: userData.email,
      subject: 'Welcome!',
      body: `Hi ${userData.name}!`
    });
  }
);

// Takes 30-45 seconds to cold start
// Runs in GCP infrastructure
// Full access to Google Cloud services
```

**Strengths:**
- Rich trigger system (database, auth, storage, pubsub)
- Multiple language support
- Deep Google Cloud integration
- Battle-tested at scale

**Limitations:**
- Slow cold starts (30-45 seconds for Node.js)
- More expensive than some alternatives
- Requires separate deployment workflow

### Supabase Edge Functions

**Capabilities:**
- HTTP endpoints
- Database webhooks (triggers)
- Deno runtime (TypeScript-first)
- Globally distributed
- Direct database access
- Scheduled functions (pg_cron)

**Pricing (2025):**
- **Free**: 500k invocations/month
- **Pro**: 2 million invocations/month ($25/month total)
- **Overage**: $2 per million additional

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Edge Function with direct DB access
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts';
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2';

serve(async (req) => {
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY')!
  );

  // Query database directly
  const { data: users } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('*')
    .limit(10);

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(users), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
});

// Cold start: <100ms
// Uses Deno runtime
// TypeScript native
```

**Database Triggers with Postgres:**
```sql
-- Direct database trigger (no Cloud Function needed)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO user_profiles (user_id, created_at)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NOW());

  -- Call Edge Function if needed
  PERFORM net.http_post(
    url := 'https://your-edge-function.com/welcome',
    body := jsonb_build_object('user_id', NEW.id)
  );

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER on_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_new_user();
```

**Strengths:**
- Sub-100ms cold starts (Deno is fast)
- TypeScript-first, modern runtime
- Direct database access (no API calls needed)
- Globally distributed on edge network
- Simpler deployment (CLI integration)

**Limitations:**
- Deno ecosystem smaller than Node.js
- No multi-language support (TypeScript only)
- Less mature trigger system

### Functions Winner: Depends on Use Case

**Choose Firebase Functions if:**
- You need triggers for everything (deep integration)
- Multi-language support is important
- You're already using GCP services
- You need battle-tested enterprise scale

**Choose Supabase Edge Functions if:**
- Cold start performance matters
- You prefer TypeScript and modern runtime
- Direct database access simplifies your code
- Global edge distribution is valuable

## Pricing Reality: What You'll Actually Pay

Let me show you real scenarios, not marketing tiers.

### Scenario 1: Side Project / MVP (5,000 Users, 1M API Calls/Month)

**Firebase:**
- Firestore: 100k reads/day = 3M reads/month
- 3M reads × $0.06 per 100k = **$1.80**
- Storage: 2GB + 10GB bandwidth = **$1.25**
- Functions: 500k invocations = **Free**
- **Total: ~$3/month** ✅ (Blaze plan)

**Supabase:**
- **Free tier covers this entirely**: ✅
- 500MB database (plenty for 5k users)
- 1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth
- 2GB egress (API calls)
- **Total: $0/month**

**Winner:** Supabase (completely free)

### Scenario 2: Growing SaaS (50,000 Users, 10M API Calls/Month)

**Firebase:**
- Firestore: 1M reads/day = 30M reads/month
- 30M reads × $0.06 per 100k = **$18.00**
- 500k writes/day = 15M writes/month
- 15M writes × $0.18 per 100k = **$27.00**
- Storage: 50GB + 200GB bandwidth = **$26.70**
- Functions: 5M invocations = **$1.20**
- **Total: ~$73/month** 💰

**Supabase:**
- **Pro Plan: $25/month** includes:
- 8GB database
- 100GB storage + 200GB bandwidth
- 50GB egress
- Unlimited API requests (this is key!)
- 2M Edge Function invocations
- **Total: $25/month** ✅

**Winner:** Supabase (almost 3× cheaper)

**Why the difference?** Firebase charges per operation. 10M API calls = potentially 50M+ database operations (reads across collections). Supabase charges for resources, unlimited API calls.

### Scenario 3: Production App (200,000 Users, Real-Time + Analytics)

**Firebase:**
- Firestore: 5M reads/day = 150M reads/month = **$90**
- Writes: 2M writes/day = 60M writes/month = **$108**
- Real-time Database (for chat): 10GB = **$50**
- Storage: 500GB + 2TB bandwidth = **$266**
- Functions: 20M invocations = **$7.20**
- **Total: ~$521/month** 💸

**Supabase:**
- **Team Plan: $599/month** includes:
- 64GB database
- 500GB storage + 1000GB bandwidth
- 500GB egress
- Unlimited API requests
- 10M Edge Function invocations
- **Additional costs:**
- Extra bandwidth if needed: ~$45 (500GB over)
- **Total: ~$644/month**

**Winner:** Firebase (slightly cheaper at this scale)

**Why Firebase wins here:** At massive scale, Firebase's per-operation pricing can be optimized with caching, while Supabase's bandwidth costs grow. However, predictability still favors Supabase.

### Scenario 4: AI Application with Vectors (10,000 Users, RAG Application)

**Firebase:**
- Firestore with Vector Search (Preview 2025)
- Database operations: **$25/month**
- Vertex AI for embeddings: **$150/month**
- Storage: **$15/month**
- Functions for orchestration: **$10/month**
- **Total: ~$200/month**

**Supabase:**
- Pro Plan: **$25/month**
- pgvector extension (included)
- Vector storage in database (no extra cost)
- Edge Functions for OpenAI calls: **$15/month** (API costs)
- **Total: ~$40/month**

**Winner:** Supabase (dramatically cheaper for AI workflows)

**Why:** PostgreSQL with pgvector means no separate vector database. Firebase requires Vertex AI or separate services.

### The Unpredictability Factor

**Firebase's Risk:**
```
Month 1: $45
Month 2: $52
Month 3: $143 😱 (went viral on HackerNews)
Month 4: $67
```

**Supabase's Predictability:**
```
Month 1: $25
Month 2: $25
Month 3: $25 (viral traffic → slight slowdown, but no surprise bill)
Month 4: $25 (or upgrade to Team if sustained growth)
```

**Real story:** A Firebase developer posted on Twitter about a $1,800 surprise bill after their app got featured on Product Hunt. Automated bots hammered their Firestore with read requests. With Supabase, this wouldn't happen—API requests are unlimited.

## AI and Vector Embeddings: The Future is Here

This is where things get really interesting in 2025.

### Firebase + Vector Search (2025 Preview)

**Setup:**
```javascript
// Firebase in-database vector search (new in 2025)
import { collection, query } from 'firebase/firestore';

// Create vector field
const docRef = await addDoc(collection(db, 'documents'), {
  content: 'AI agents are transforming development...',
  embedding: vectorEmbedding, // 1536-dimension array
  metadata: { category: 'ai', author: 'Alice' }
});

// Vector similarity search
const nearestDocs = await vectorQuery(
  collection(db, 'documents'),
  vectorField('embedding'),
  vectorNear(queryEmbedding),
  limit(10)
);

// Hybrid search (vector + filters)
const q = query(
  collection(db, 'documents'),
  where('category', '==', 'ai'),
  vectorNear('embedding', queryEmbedding)
);
```

**Pros:**
- Integrated with Firestore (no separate DB)
- Vertex AI integration for embeddings
- Google's AI infrastructure

**Cons:**
- Still in preview (not GA yet)
- Requires Vertex AI (extra costs)
- Limited filtering capabilities with vectors
- Proprietary implementation

### Supabase + pgvector (Production Ready)

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Enable pgvector extension
CREATE EXTENSION vector;

-- Create table with vector column
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT,
  embedding vector(1536),  -- OpenAI embedding size
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create vector index (HNSW for fast similarity search)
CREATE INDEX ON documents
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
```

**Querying:**
```typescript
// Generate embedding (using OpenAI)
const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
  input: query
});

// Semantic search with metadata filtering
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('search_documents', {
  query_embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,
  match_threshold: 0.8,
  match_count: 10,
  filter_category: 'ai'
});

// The SQL function:
CREATE FUNCTION search_documents(
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_threshold float,
  match_count int,
  filter_category text
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  content text,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE SQL
AS $$
  SELECT
    id,
    content,
    1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM documents
  WHERE
    metadata->>'category' = filter_category
    AND 1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
  ORDER BY embedding <=> query_embedding
  LIMIT match_count;
$$;
```

**Real RAG Example:**
```typescript
// Complete RAG pipeline in Supabase Edge Function
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts';
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2';
import OpenAI from 'https://esm.sh/openai@4';

serve(async (req) => {
  const { question } = await req.json();

  // 1. Generate embedding for question
  const openai = new OpenAI();
  const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: 'text-embedding-3-small',
    input: question
  });

  // 2. Vector search for relevant docs
  const supabase = createClient(url, key);
  const { data: docs } = await supabase.rpc('search_documents', {
    query_embedding: embedding.data[0].embedding,
    match_threshold: 0.7,
    match_count: 5
  });

  // 3. Build context from retrieved docs
  const context = docs.map(d => d.content).join('\n\n');

  // 4. Generate answer with Claude/GPT
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o',
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content: `Answer based on this context:\n${context}`
      },
      { role: 'user', content: question }
    ]
  });

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({
    answer: completion.choices[0].message.content,
    sources: docs
  }));
});
```

**Pros:**
- Production-ready (pgvector is battle-tested)
- Full PostgreSQL power (complex filters with vectors)
- Provider-agnostic (OpenAI, Cohere, custom models)
- 1.6M+ embeddings stored by Supabase users
- Open-source (no vendor lock-in)

**Cons:**
- Requires more setup than Firebase (when it's GA)
- Need to manage embedding generation separately

### AI/ML Winner: Supabase (in 2025)

**Why:**
- pgvector is production-ready NOW
- PostgreSQL's flexibility for complex hybrid search
- Much cheaper (no separate vector DB or Vertex AI required)
- Already powering AI apps for 1.7M developers

Firebase's vector search shows promise, but it's still preview. When it goes GA, this might change.

## Real-Time Capabilities: Both Excellent

### Firebase Realtime Database & Firestore

**Approach:**
```javascript
// Firestore real-time subscription
import { onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore';

const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
  doc(db, 'chatrooms', roomId),
  (doc) => {
    const messages = doc.data().messages;
    updateUI(messages);
  }
);

// Automatic sync, offline support, conflict resolution
```

**Strengths:**
- Battle-tested at massive scale (Google Meet, etc.)
- Automatic offline support
- Conflict resolution built-in
- Works seamlessly across Firebase SDKs

**Limitations:**
- Charged per operation (reads on every change)
- Limited query complexity in subscriptions

### Supabase Realtime

**Approach:**
```typescript
// Supabase real-time subscription
const channel = supabase
  .channel('chatroom')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: `room_id=eq.${roomId}`
    },
    (payload) => {
      updateUI(payload.new);
    }
  )
  .subscribe();

// Powered by PostgreSQL's logical replication
```

**Strengths:**
- Unlimited subscriptions (included in plan)
- Subscribe to database changes directly
- Can use complex SQL filters
- Presence tracking built-in

**Limitations:**
- Fewer offline capabilities than Firebase
- Newer technology (less battle-tested)

### Real-Time Winner: Firebase (Mature Edge to Firebase)

For mission-critical real-time apps (chat, collaboration, multiplayer games), Firebase's maturity wins. Supabase Realtime is excellent but newer.

## Migration: The Exit Strategy Test

### Migrating FROM Firebase

**Difficulty: 6/10** 😓

**The Process:**
1. **Export Firestore data** (JSON/CSV via Firebase CLI)
2. **Transform NoSQL to SQL** (denormalized → normalized)
3. **Rewrite queries** (Firestore SDK → SQL queries)
4. **Rewrite security rules** (Firebase rules → RLS policies)
5. **Update auth integration** (Firebase Auth → Supabase Auth)
6. **Migrate storage files** (Cloud Storage → Supabase Storage)

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks for medium app (with parallel operation)

**Real Migration Example:**
```javascript
// Before (Firebase)
const tasks = await getDocs(
  query(
    collection(db, 'tasks'),
    where('userId', '==', currentUser.uid),
    where('status', '==', 'active'),
    orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')
  )
);

// After (Supabase)
const { data: tasks } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

**Tools to Help:**
- Supabase provides Firebase Auth migration tool
- Firestore to Postgres scripts (community-maintained)
- Storage migration utilities

**Hardest Part:** Transforming denormalized NoSQL data into normalized SQL schema. This requires understanding your data relationships, not just copying documents.

### Migrating FROM Supabase

**Difficulty: 3/10** ✅

**The Process:**
1. **Export PostgreSQL database** (`pg_dump` standard tool)
2. **Migrate to any PostgreSQL host** (AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, self-hosted)
3. **Update connection string** (that's it for database)

**Timeline:** Hours to 1 day

**Why It's Easier:**
- It's just PostgreSQL (standard, portable)
- No proprietary formats
- Standard SQL dump/restore
- Can even self-host the entire Supabase stack (it's open-source)

**Migration to RDS Example:**
```bash
# Export from Supabase
pg_dump $SUPABASE_DB_URL > backup.sql

# Import to AWS RDS
psql $AWS_RDS_URL < backup.sql

# Update connection string in app
# Done.
```

**Self-Hosting Supabase:**
```bash
# Clone and run locally or on your servers
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase
cd supabase/docker
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up -d

# You now own your entire backend stack
```

### Migration Winner: Supabase (No Vendor Lock-In)

Firebase's proprietary nature makes exiting painful. Supabase's open-source PostgreSQL foundation means you're never trapped.

## Developer Experience: Subjective but Important

### Firebase: Magical but Constraining

**The Good:**
- **Instant gratification**: Auth + database + hosting in 10 minutes
- **Amazing documentation**: Firebase docs are legendary
- **Mature ecosystem**: 10+ years of Stack Overflow answers
- **Google Console**: Familiar UI for GCP users
- **SDKs everywhere**: Every platform, every language

**The Frustrating:**
- **Black box**: Can't inspect internals when debugging
- **Limited power**: Can't do complex queries without hacks
- **Functions pain**: Cold starts and deployment friction
- **Console limits**: Can't run arbitrary queries in dashboard

**Typical Firebase Flow:**
```
Idea → 30 min → Working prototype ✅
Prototype → Production → Hit scaling walls 😓
Refactor with denormalization → Works but messy 🤷
Advanced features → Rewrite or workarounds 😤
```

### Supabase: Powerful but Requires Knowledge

**The Good:**
- **Full transparency**: `psql` directly into your database
- **Unlimited power**: If PostgreSQL can do it, you can do it
- **Modern DX**: Beautiful dashboard, clear documentation
- **TypeScript-first**: Auto-generated types, Edge Functions
- **Open source**: Read the code, contribute, self-host

**The Challenging:**
- **SQL required**: If you don't know SQL, learning curve is steep
- **More decisions**: Schema design, indexes, migrations
- **RLS complexity**: Powerful but requires understanding
- **Less hand-holding**: You have control, but responsibility too

**Typical Supabase Flow:**
```
Idea → Design schema (thinking required) 🤔
1-2 hours → Working prototype ✅
Prototype → Production → Scales smoothly ✅
Advanced features → Just use PostgreSQL ✅
```

### Which Feels Better?

**Firebase feels better if:**
- You want to ship NOW
- You don't want to think about databases
- You prefer guidance over control
- You're prototyping or learning

**Supabase feels better if:**
- You appreciate database fundamentals
- You like understanding your stack
- You prefer power over convenience
- You're building something serious

**My experience:** Firebase felt magical for 2 weeks. Then every new feature felt like fighting the framework. Supabase felt complex for 2 weeks. Then every new feature felt natural.

## The Verdict: It's Not One-Size-Fits-All

After using both platforms in production, here's my honest take:

**Firebase is a Ferrari.** Fast, powerful, gets you there quick. But you're locked into Ferrari's maintenance, Ferrari's fuel, Ferrari's rules. Try to modify it yourself? Good luck.

**Supabase is a well-built car with the hood open.** Maybe takes a bit more to learn the engine, but you understand it, can fix it, can modify it, and can even build a new one from the same parts if needed.

### My Current Setup (November 2025)

**Personal projects & MVPs:** Firebase
**Why:** Speed, familiar, don't overthink it

**Production SaaS apps:** Supabase
**Why:** Control, predictability, PostgreSQL power

**AI applications:** Supabase 100%
**Why:** pgvector, cost-effective, no vendor lock-in

**Mobile apps (if I built them):** Firebase
**Why:** Superior SDKs, offline support

### What I Recommend to Others

**Beginners / Students:** Start with Firebase
- Get productive fast
- Focus on building, not database design
- Free tier is generous
- Learn backend concepts without SQL complexity

**Junior Developers:** Try both!
- Firebase for quick projects
- Supabase to learn SQL and database fundamentals
- Understanding both makes you more valuable

**Mid-Level Developers:** Lean toward Supabase
- You likely know SQL already
- You want control and transparency
- You're building more complex apps
- Vendor lock-in concerns are valid

**Senior Developers:** Use the right tool for the job
- Firebase for mobile-first and rapid prototyping
- Supabase for data-heavy and AI applications
- Evaluate based on specific requirements, not trends

### The Future (My Prediction)

**By 2026:**
- Firebase will have GA vector search and more AI features
- Supabase will continue rapid growth (on track for 3M+ developers)
- More developers will use BOTH for different projects
- The "Firebase vs Supabase" debate will become "Firebase for X, Supabase for Y"

**The Real Insight:**
These aren't competitors in the traditional sense. They're solving overlapping but different problems. Firebase optimizes for developer velocity and managed complexity. Supabase optimizes for power, transparency, and cost predictability.

Choose based on YOUR priorities, not blog posts (including this one).

## Conclusion: Power or Convenience?

The Firebase vs Supabase choice ultimately comes down to this question:

**Do you want convenience or do you want control?**

If you want to ship fast and trust Google to handle complexity → **Firebase**
If you want transparency and full power of SQL → **Supabase**

**Key takeaways:**
- SQL vs NoSQL is the fundamental difference—everything flows from this
- Firebase excels at mobile-first and rapid prototyping
- Supabase dominates for AI apps and data-heavy applications
- Firebase's per-operation pricing can surprise you; Supabase is predictable
- Supabase's open-source nature prevents vendor lock-in
- Both have excellent auth, storage, and functions
- Real-time: Firebase more mature, Supabase catching up fast
- Choose based on YOUR specific needs, not hype

### My Final Recommendation

**If you're reading this and unsure:**

Try Firebase first for a weekend project. Get that magical feeling of shipping fast.

Then build something in Supabase and learn SQL properly. Appreciate the power and control.

After that, you'll instinctively know which to choose for each project.

### My Production Setup (November 2025)

**Currently Running:**
- 1 Firebase project (mobile app, ~8k users) - $12/month
- 3 Supabase projects (SaaS + AI apps) - $25/month total
- 0 regrets about using both

**Would I migrate everything to one platform?** No. Each shines where it shines.

**Which would I bet my startup on?** Supabase. The open-source foundation, predictable pricing, and PostgreSQL power are too valuable for a growing business.

**Which would I teach my kid to use first?** Firebase. The instant gratification builds confidence. Then teach SQL with Supabase.
