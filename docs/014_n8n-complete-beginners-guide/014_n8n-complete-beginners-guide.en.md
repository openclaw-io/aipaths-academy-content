# n8n Complete Beginner's Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about n8n—from understanding what it is to choosing the right hosting option for your needs. Whether you're a developer looking to automate personal workflows or someone evaluating automation tools for your team, this guide will help you make informed decisions.

By the end, you'll understand n8n's core concepts, know your hosting options, and be able to compare it against alternatives like Zapier and Make.

## What is n8n?

**n8n** (pronounced "n-eight-n", short for "nodemation") is an open-source, low-code workflow automation platform. It connects different applications and services visually, allowing you to automate repetitive tasks without writing complex code.

Think of it as: *"When X happens in App A, do Y in App B."*

### Key Characteristics

- **Open-source** with a fair-code license and free self-hosted option
- **Low-code/no-code** visual interface with optional JavaScript for technical users
- **500+ integrations** out of the box (Gmail, Slack, Notion, databases, APIs, etc.)
- **AI-native** with ~70 nodes for AI/LLM workflows (OpenAI, LangChain, etc.)
- **Self-hostable** for complete data privacy and unlimited usage

### What Makes n8n Different

Unlike fully-managed platforms like Zapier, n8n gives you the option to run everything on your own infrastructure. This means:

- **No execution limits** when self-hosted
- **Complete data privacy**—your data never leaves your server
- **Full customization**—write JavaScript, connect to databases directly, modify anything
- **Cost savings**—pay only for server hosting, not per-workflow fees

## Core Concepts

Before diving deeper, let's understand the terminology you'll encounter when using n8n.

### Workflows

A **workflow** is a sequence of connected nodes that automate a process. You design workflows visually in the n8n editor, and they're saved as JSON objects in the database.

```text
[Trigger] → [Node 1] → [Node 2] → [Node 3] → [Output]
    ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
  Event    Transform    API Call    Result
```

Data flows from left to right. Each node receives input from the previous node, processes it, and passes output to the next.

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of any n8n workflow. Each node performs one specific action—send an email, query a database, transform data, etc.

**Types of nodes:**

| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Trigger Nodes** | Start workflows when events occur | Webhook, Schedule, Manual |
| **App Nodes** | Connect to specific services | Gmail, Slack, Notion, Stripe |
| **Core Nodes** | Handle logic and data operations | IF, Loop, Merge, Split |
| **Function Nodes** | Execute custom JavaScript code | Code, Function |

### Triggers

A **trigger** is a special node that starts your workflow. Without a trigger, workflows don't run.

**Common trigger types:**

- **Webhook Trigger**: Runs when an external app sends an HTTP request
- **Schedule/Cron Trigger**: Runs on a schedule (e.g., every day at 9 AM)
- **Manual Trigger**: Click a button to run (useful for testing)
- **App Triggers**: When a new email arrives, new Slack message, etc.

### Webhooks

Webhooks are URL endpoints that receive external HTTP requests. When another service sends data to your webhook URL, it triggers the workflow.

**Key points:**

- n8n generates two URLs per webhook: **Test** (for debugging) and **Production**
- Maximum payload size is 16MB
- Webhooks can also return data, making them useful for building API endpoints

### Executions

An **execution** is one complete run of a workflow from trigger to end. This is how n8n Cloud pricing works—you pay per execution.

## Hosting Options

You have three main options for running n8n. Each has trade-offs between cost, convenience, and control.

### Option 1: n8n Cloud (Managed)

n8n hosts and manages everything for you.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero setup—sign up and start | Costs €20-60+/month |
| Automatic updates and backups | Execution limits (2,500/month on Starter) |
| Official support included | Data hosted externally |
| Scales automatically | Limited customization |

**Best for:** Non-technical users, small teams, quick testing, low-to-medium execution volume.

**Pricing (2025):**

| Plan | Cost | Executions | Active Workflows |
|------|------|------------|------------------|
| Free | €0 | 200/month | 1 only |
| Starter | €20/month | 2,500/month | Unlimited |
| Pro | €50/month | More | Unlimited |

### Option 2: Self-Hosted (Docker)

You run n8n on your own server using Docker. This is the **free option**.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| **Completely free** (unlimited workflows/executions) | Requires technical skills |
| Full data privacy—stays on your server | You handle updates and maintenance |
| Deep customization possible | No official support |
| No execution limits | You manage backups and security |

**Best for:** Technical users, developers, privacy-sensitive projects, high-volume automation.

**Requirements:**

- VPS with 2 CPU / 4GB RAM (minimum 1 CPU / 1-2GB to start)
- Docker + Docker Compose installed
- Linux (Ubuntu recommended)
- Optional: PostgreSQL for production (instead of default SQLite)

### Option 3: Managed Docker Hosting

Platforms like Sliplane (~€9/month) handle the server while you keep control. One-click deployment, automatic updates, but you still own the instance.

**Best for:** Technical users who want self-hosting benefits without server management.

### Quick Comparison

| Factor | n8n Cloud | Self-Hosted | Managed (Sliplane) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cost | €20-60+/month | Free (server costs only) | ~€9/month |
| Setup | Instant | 30-60 min | 5 min |
| Maintenance | None | You handle it | Minimal |
| Data Privacy | External | Full control | Your instance |
| Execution Limits | Yes | No | No |
| Technical Skill | None | Docker/Linux | Basic |
