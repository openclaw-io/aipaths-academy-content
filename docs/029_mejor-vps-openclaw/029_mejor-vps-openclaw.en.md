## What does OpenClaw need from a VPS?

OpenClaw is a Node.js application that orchestrates AI agents. The heavy compute happens on the API provider's side (Anthropic, OpenAI), not on your server. This means you don't need a powerful machine — you need a reliable one. Minimum specs: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, 20GB SSD, Ubuntu 22.04+. Recommended: 2 vCPU, 2-4GB RAM, 40GB SSD. Key factors: uptime reliability, network latency to API providers, SSH security, and cost predictability.

## Recommended specs by use case

Light use (1-2 agents, basic automations): 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM, ~$4-6/month. Standard use (3-5 agents, messaging integrations, n8n): 2 vCPU, 2-4GB RAM, ~$6-15/month. Heavy use (5+ agents, local models with Ollama, databases): 4 vCPU, 8GB+ RAM, ~$15-30/month.

## Top 5: Best VPS for OpenClaw in 2026

### 1. 🥇 Hetzner Cloud — The community favorite

Best price-to-performance ratio in Europe. Data centers in Germany and Finland. Starting from ~$4/month for 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM. Excellent uptime, fast provisioning, clean interface. The most recommended VPS on Reddit's self-hosting communities. Limitation: no US data centers (higher latency to US-based APIs, though still acceptable).

### 2. 🥈 Contabo — Raw power at ridiculous prices

More specs for less money than anyone else. 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM for ~$7/month. Great for running local models alongside OpenClaw. Trade-off: support quality is variable, network speeds can be inconsistent, and provisioning is slower. Good for experimentation and budget-conscious setups.

### 3. 🥉 DigitalOcean — The simplest option

Best documentation, simplest interface, great for beginners. Starting from $6/month (1 vCPU, 1GB RAM). US and EU data centers. Excellent tutorials and community. Slightly more expensive per spec than Hetzner, but the ease of use makes up for it.

### 4. Vultr — Best global coverage

32 data center locations worldwide, including Latin America (São Paulo, Santiago). Best option if you need low latency from LATAM. Competitive pricing starting at ~$6/month. Good API for automation.

### 5. Hostinger — Accessible option

Budget-friendly with frequent discounts. Good for getting started. Starting from ~$5/month. Solid basic features. Less flexible than the others for advanced configurations.

### Special mention: Oracle Cloud Free Tier ($0/month)

Oracle offers an always-free tier that includes ARM-based instances with up to 4 OCPUs and 24GB RAM. Enough to run OpenClaw and even small local models. The catch: availability is limited (you may need to try multiple times to provision), and Oracle's interface is more complex than the others. But if you get it, it's genuinely free forever.

## Security: what you MUST know before installing

A VPS running an AI agent is an attractive target. Essential security measures: SSH with keys only (disable password auth). Firewall (ufw): only open ports you need (22 for SSH, 443 if needed). Tailscale: the #1 community recommendation — creates a private encrypted network so you never expose ports publicly. Fail2ban for SSH brute force protection. Automatic security updates. Dedicated user for the agent (never run as root). See our Security Guide for AI Agents for the complete setup.

## Quick decision tree: which one to choose?

Best value → Hetzner. Most specs for least money → Contabo. Simplest setup → DigitalOcean. Need LATAM data center → Vultr. Tightest budget → Hostinger or Oracle Free Tier. Want to run local models too → Contabo (8GB+ RAM cheap). First time with a VPS → DigitalOcean (best docs and tutorials).

## Hidden costs to consider

Beyond the monthly VPS fee: bandwidth overages (most plans include 1-20TB, usually enough), backup storage (optional but recommended, $1-3/month), domain name if you want a custom one ($10-15/year), your time for maintenance and security updates. Total realistic cost for a well-configured OpenClaw VPS: $6-15/month all-in for most users.

## Conclusion: our recommendation

For most users: Hetzner Cloud. Best price-to-performance, reliable, and the community favorite for self-hosting AI agents. If you're in LATAM and need low latency: Vultr with their São Paulo data center. If it's your first VPS ever: DigitalOcean — the documentation alone is worth the slight premium. And if you're still deciding between a VPS and your own hardware (Mac Mini), check our guide on Where to Run Your AI Agent for the full comparison.
