# Validating Your Idea Before Building: A Framework-Driven Guide

**You have an idea. Now what?**

You've done the hard work of [finding your niche](https://www.aipaths.academy/es/docs/008_finding-profitable-niche-guide). You've identified a specific audience with a pressing problem. You're excited. You want to start building.

**Stop.**

This is the moment where most entrepreneurs make their most expensive mistake: they start building before validating.

According to [CB Insights research](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/), **42% of startups fail because there's no market need**. Not because the product was bad. Not because the team was incompetent. Because nobody actually wanted what they built.

The graveyard of failed startups is filled with brilliant solutions to problems nobody has.

This guide will teach you the frameworks, psychology, and practical methods to validate your idea before you invest months of development time and thousands of dollars. You'll learn to seek truth, not confirmation—and you'll save yourself from the pain of building something nobody wants.

## The Psychology of Validation

Before we dive into tactics, we need to address the real challenge: **your own psychology**.

### Why We Skip Validation

Every entrepreneur knows they should validate. So why do most skip it?

**1. Confirmation Bias**

Your brain is wired to seek information that confirms what you already believe. When you're excited about an idea, you unconsciously:
- Interpret ambiguous feedback as positive
- Remember supportive comments, forget skeptical ones
- Ask leading questions that generate the answers you want

**The fix:** Approach validation like a scientist, not a salesperson. Your job is to **disprove** your idea, not prove it. If it survives your attempts to kill it, it might actually work.

**2. Fear of Rejection**

Putting your idea in front of real people feels vulnerable. What if they hate it? What if they laugh? What if you're wrong?

This fear causes entrepreneurs to:
- "Stealth mode" for months (hiding from feedback)
- Only share with friends and family (who won't be honest)
- Over-polish before showing anyone (delaying the inevitable)

**The fix:** Reframe rejection as information. Every "no" teaches you something. Every piece of negative feedback makes your final product better. The worst outcome isn't rejection—it's building something nobody wants.

**3. The Builder's Trap**

Developers especially fall into this trap: building feels productive, while validation feels like procrastination.

"I'll just build a quick MVP and see if people like it."

This sounds reasonable but ignores opportunity cost. That "quick MVP" takes 3-6 months. During that time, you could have:
- Talked to 100 potential customers
- Run 5 different smoke tests
- Pre-sold to 10 paying clients
- Pivoted 3 times based on real feedback

**The fix:** Treat validation as the first phase of building, not a delay to building. The insights you gain will make your actual build 10x faster and more likely to succeed.

### The Validation Mindset

Adopt these mental models before starting:

**1. You Are a Detective, Not a Lawyer**

A lawyer builds a case for a predetermined conclusion. A detective follows evidence wherever it leads.

Be a detective. Your job is to uncover truth, not defend your idea.

**2. Seek Disconfirming Evidence**

Actively look for reasons your idea won't work:
- Who would NOT buy this?
- What could make this fail?
- What assumptions am I making?

If you can't find holes in your idea, you're not looking hard enough.

**3. Small Bets, Fast Learning**

Don't bet everything on one validation method. Run multiple small experiments quickly. The goal is learning velocity, not perfection.

**4. Money Talks, Everything Else Walks**

People say lots of things. They say "Great idea!" They say "I'd definitely buy that!" They say "Let me know when it launches!"

These statements are worthless.

The only validation that truly matters is **money changing hands** or **behavior that costs something** (time, reputation, effort). Everything else is noise.

## The Validation Spectrum

Validation isn't binary (validated vs. not validated). It's a spectrum of increasing confidence.

Each level builds on the previous one. Don't skip levels—the insights compound.

**When to advance:**
- Level 1 → 2: You found search demand and competition
- Level 2 → 3: 8/10+ interviews confirmed the problem is urgent
- Level 3 → 4: 5-10% of landing page visitors showed purchase intent
- Level 4 → 5: You have 3-5 pre-paying customers
- Level 5 → Build: Customers are getting value and would pay more

**When to stop and pivot:**
- Level 1: No search demand, no competition, declining trends
- Level 2: People don't have the problem or don't care about solving it
- Level 3: &lt;2% conversion despite good traffic
- Level 4: Nobody will pre-pay even with heavy discounts
- Level 5: Manual delivery reveals the solution doesn't actually help

---

## Level 1: Research Signals

**Effort:** Low (2-4 hours)
**Confidence:** Low
**What you're testing:** Does demand exist at all?

If you followed our [Finding Your Profitable Niche](https://www.aipaths.academy/es/docs/008_finding-profitable-niche-guide) guide, you've already done much of this. Here's a quick recap of the key signals:

### Search Demand

**Google Trends:** Is interest growing, stable, or declining?
- ✅ Steady upward trend over 3-5 years
- ⚠️ Stable (neither growing nor shrinking)
- ❌ Declining interest

**Keyword Research:** Are people searching for solutions?
- ✅ 1,000+ monthly searches for main keyword
- ✅ Multiple related long-tail keywords
- ❌ &lt;100 monthly searches

### Competition Signals

**Counterintuitive truth:** Competition is usually GOOD.

Competition means:
- The market exists
- People are willing to pay
- The problem is real enough that others are solving it

**Danger signs:**
- Zero competition = Maybe no market exists
- Dominated by massive players = Hard to differentiate
- Lots of recent failures = Something structural is wrong

**Ideal scenario:** 3-10 competitors, none dominant, some doing well but room for improvement.

### Community Activity

Are people actively discussing this problem?
- Reddit threads with 100+ upvotes
- Active Facebook groups
- YouTube videos with engagement
- Forum discussions and questions

**What to look for:**
- Recurring complaints
- Requests for recommendations
- Frustration with existing solutions
- Questions with many upvotes but few good answers

### Research Signals Checklist

Before moving to Level 2, confirm:

- [ ] Google Trends shows stable or growing interest
- [ ] At least 500+ monthly searches for core keywords
- [ ] 3-10 competitors exist (not 0, not 100)
- [ ] Active community discussions about the problem
- [ ] No obvious structural reason for market failure

If you can't check most of these boxes, reconsider the idea before investing more effort.

---

## Level 2: Problem Interviews

**Effort:** Medium (10-20 hours)
**Confidence:** Medium-Low
**What you're testing:** Is this problem urgent enough to solve?

Research tells you people search for something. Interviews tell you why—and whether they'd actually pay to solve it.

### The Mom Test Framework

Named after Rob Fitzpatrick's essential book, [The Mom Test](http://momtestbook.com/), this framework prevents the most common interview mistake: asking questions that generate false positives.

**The problem:** If you ask your mom "Do you think my business idea is good?", she'll say yes. She loves you. She wants to be supportive. Her opinion is worthless for validation.

Most potential customers are the same—they'll tell you what you want to hear to be polite.

**The solution:** Ask about the past, not the future. Ask about specifics, not hypotheticals.

### Bad Questions vs. Good Questions

**❌ Bad Questions (Hypothetical/Future):**
- "Would you pay for a tool that does X?"
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- "How much would you pay for this?"
- "Would you use this if I built it?"

**Why they're bad:** People are terrible at predicting their own behavior. They'll say "yes" to be nice, then never buy.

**✅ Good Questions (Past/Specific):**
- "Walk me through the last time you dealt with [problem]."
- "What solutions have you already tried?"
- "How much have you spent trying to solve this?"
- "What happened after you tried [solution]?"
- "How much time do you spend on this every week?"

**Why they work:** Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. If they've already spent money/time trying to solve this, they'll likely do it again.

### The Interview Script

Here's a framework for a 20-30 minute problem interview:

**Opening (2 min):**
"Thanks for taking the time. I'm researching how [target audience] handle [problem area]. I'm not selling anything—just trying to understand the landscape. Mind if I ask some questions about your experience?"

**Context (5 min):**
- "Tell me about your role and what you do day-to-day."
- "Where does [problem area] fit into your work?"

**Problem Exploration (10 min):**
- "Walk me through the last time you dealt with [specific problem]."
- "What made that particularly frustrating/time-consuming?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What does this cost you in time/money/stress?"

**Current Solutions (5 min):**
- "What are you currently doing to handle this?"
- "What have you tried before? What worked and what didn't?"
- "How much have you spent on solutions so far?"

**Closing (5 min):**
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [problem area], what would it be?"
- "Is there anything else about [problem] that I should understand?"
- "Do you know anyone else who deals with this that I should talk to?"

### What You're Listening For

**Green flags (problem is real and urgent):**
- They interrupt you to elaborate on their pain
- They've already spent money trying to solve it
- They can quantify the cost (time, money, stress)
- They ask when your solution will be ready
- They offer to introduce you to others with the same problem

**Red flags (problem isn't urgent enough):**
- They can't articulate the problem clearly
- They've never tried to solve it
- They say "that's interesting" (polite disinterest)
- They won't commit to a follow-up conversation
- The problem is annual, not daily/weekly

### Interview Targets

**How many interviews?** Aim for 10-20 conversations in your target audience.

**Where to find people:**
- LinkedIn (direct outreach)
- Reddit and community forums
- Facebook groups
- Twitter/X
- Your existing network
- Asking interviewees for referrals

**Incentives:** Offer value in exchange:
- A summary of your findings
- Free consultation on a related topic
- Early access to whatever you build
- A small gift card ($10-25)

### Synthesizing Interview Data

After 10+ interviews, look for patterns:

**Document for each interview:**
1. Specific pain points mentioned (exact words they used)
2. Current solutions they've tried
3. Money/time already spent on the problem
4. Urgency signals (or lack thereof)
5. Would they take a follow-up action? (beta test, call, etc.)

**Aggregate analysis:**
- What problem did 8/10+ people mention?
- What language did they consistently use?
- What existing solutions are most common?
- What gaps exist in current solutions?

**Decision point:**
- 8/10+ confirmed urgent problem → Move to Level 3
- 5-7/10 confirmed → Refine your target audience and do more interviews
- &lt;5/10 confirmed → Pivot to a different problem or audience

---

## Level 3: Smoke Tests

**Effort:** Medium (20-40 hours + small ad budget)
**Confidence:** Medium-High
**What you're testing:** Will people take action, not just talk?

This is where validation gets real. Smoke tests measure **actual behavior**, not stated intentions.

### What Is a Smoke Test?

A smoke test creates the illusion of a product or service to measure genuine interest. It's called a "smoke test" because you're checking for smoke (interest) before there's fire (a real product).

**Common smoke test types:**

1. **Landing Page MVP** - A single page describing your offer with a signup/buy button
2. **Fake Door Test** - A button or feature that doesn't work yet, measuring clicks
3. **Explainer Video** - A video showing how the product would work
4. **Waitlist** - A signup for early access
5. **Coming Soon Page** - Announce the product with an email capture

### Why Smoke Tests Beat Interviews

Smoke tests overcome the two biggest problems with interviews:

**1. Actions beat words**

In an interview, saying "I'd buy that" costs nothing. On a landing page, clicking "Buy Now" or entering your email is a small commitment that signals real intent.

Research shows that [response biases like "yea-saying"](https://cxl.com/blog/smoke-test/) make interview data unreliable. Smoke tests measure what people do, not what they say they'll do.

**2. Scale**

You can interview 20 people in a week. You can get 500 people to your landing page in the same time. More data = better decisions.

### Building Your Landing Page MVP

A landing page MVP is the most common and effective smoke test. Here's what you need:

### Driving Traffic to Your Smoke Test

A landing page without traffic tells you nothing. Here's how to get visitors:

**Free methods (Week 1-2):**

| Method | Expected Traffic | Effort |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Post in 5-10 relevant Facebook Groups | 50-200 visits | Medium |
| Answer questions on Reddit (link in profile) | 20-100 visits | Medium |
| LinkedIn posts about the problem you solve | 30-150 visits | Low |
| DM 50 target customers directly | 10-30 visits | High |
| Post in Discord/Slack communities | 20-80 visits | Medium |

**Paid methods (Week 3-4):**

| Method | Budget | Expected Traffic | Best For |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | $10-20/day | 100-300 clicks | B2C, visual products |
| Google Ads (search) | $15-30/day | 50-150 clicks | High-intent searchers |
| LinkedIn Ads | $30-50/day | 30-80 clicks | B2B, professional services |
| Twitter/X Ads | $10-20/day | 50-200 clicks | Tech-savvy audiences |

**Pro tip:** Start with free methods to test your messaging, then amplify what works with paid.

### Measuring Smoke Test Success

**Key metrics to track:**

1. **Visitor-to-signup rate** (most important)
   - How many visitors enter their email or click "Buy"?
   - This is your core conversion metric

2. **Bounce rate**
   - How many leave immediately?
   - High bounce = wrong traffic or unclear value prop

3. **Time on page**
   - Are people reading or just leaving?
   - Low time = messaging isn't resonating

4. **Click-through on CTA**
   - If you have a pricing page, how many click through?
   - Shows serious intent

**What "good" looks like:**

| Metric | Poor | Okay | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Email signup rate | &lt;3% | 3-8% | 8-15% | 15%+ |
| "Buy" button clicks | &lt;1% | 1-3% | 3-5% | 5%+ |
| Bounce rate | &gt;80% | 60-80% | 40-60% | &lt;40% |
| Avg. time on page | &lt;30s | 30-60s | 1-2 min | 2+ min |

**Sample size matters:** Don't make decisions on 50 visitors. Aim for 200-500 before drawing conclusions.

### The Fake Door Test

A more aggressive smoke test: create a "Buy Now" button that doesn't actually process payment.

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "Buy Now" or "Start Free Trial"
2. They're taken to a page that says: "Thanks for your interest! We're launching soon. Enter your email to get notified and receive a special early-bird discount."
3. You measure how many people clicked vs. entered email

**Why it works:**
- Clicking "Buy Now" shows strong intent (stronger than email signup)
- You can measure willingness to pay at different price points
- The follow-up email capture still builds your list

**Ethical consideration:** Be transparent. Don't pretend the product exists when it doesn't. The "coming soon" message is honest and still provides validation.

### Smoke Test Decision Framework

After running your smoke test for 2-4 weeks with 300+ visitors:

| Result | Meaning | Next Step |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| &lt;3% signup | Weak interest | Revisit positioning, audience, or pivot |
| 3-8% signup | Moderate interest | Improve landing page, test new angles |
| 8-15% signup | Strong interest | Move to Level 4: Pre-sales |
| 15%+ signup | Exceptional interest | Move quickly, you've found something |

---

## Level 4: Pre-Sales

**Effort:** High (40+ hours)
**Confidence:** High
**What you're testing:** Will people actually pay money?

Pre-sales are the ultimate validation. When someone gives you money for something that doesn't exist yet, you know you've found real demand.

### Why Pre-Sales Matter

**"Interest" is not "intent to buy."**

People will:
- Sign up for free things they never use
- Say "I'd buy that" without meaning it
- Enter their email to be polite

People will NOT:
- Give you money for something they don't want
- Pre-pay for something they don't need
- Invest in a solution to a problem they don't have

**The psychology of commitment:**

When someone pays, even a small amount:
- They've made a decision (reducing future hesitation)
- They've invested (creating ownership and engagement)
- They're committed (more likely to become a real customer)
- They've validated with their wallet (the only vote that matters)

### Pre-Sale Models

**Model 1: The Pilot Program**

"Join our exclusive beta cohort at 50% off."

**Structure:**
- Limited spots (5-10 clients)
- Heavy discount (50-70% off future price)
- High-touch service (you're learning)
- Clear expectations ("We're building this together")

**Script:**
> "I'm launching a pilot program for [solution] with just 5 spots. Pilot members get 50% off the regular price forever, plus direct access to me for feedback and customization. In exchange, I ask for your honest feedback and a testimonial if you're happy with the results. Interested?"

**Model 2: The Founding Member Offer**

"Lock in lifetime pricing as a founding member."

**Structure:**
- Grandfathered pricing (pay $X/month forever vs. $2X regular)
- Exclusive perks (priority support, feature requests)
- Limited time or spots
- Creates urgency

**Script:**
> "I'm accepting 10 founding members for [solution]. Founding members pay $997/month forever—the price will be $1,997 after launch. You'll also get priority support and direct input on the feature roadmap. The founding member offer closes [date]. Want one of the spots?"

**Model 3: The Concierge Pre-Sale**

"I'll personally deliver the results while we build the automation."

**Structure:**
- Sell the outcome, not the product
- You manually deliver what the automation will eventually do
- Client gets results immediately
- You learn exactly what they need

**Script:**
> "Before I build the full automation, I'm working with 3 clients hands-on to make sure it solves the real problem. I'll personally handle your [task] for the next month while we refine the system. Investment is $1,500/month. If you're not seeing results by week 3, full refund."

### Pre-Sale Outreach

**Where to find pre-sale customers:**

1. **Your smoke test signups** - These people already showed interest
2. **Interview participants** - Especially those who showed urgency
3. **Warm network** - LinkedIn connections in target industry
4. **Communities** - Facebook groups, Slack channels, Discord servers
5. **Cold outreach** - LinkedIn/email to target decision-makers

**The outreach sequence:**

**Message 1 (Day 1):** Personal connection
> "Hi [Name], I saw your post about [their problem] in [community]. I've been working on a solution for exactly that. Would love to hear more about your situation—mind if I ask a few questions?"

**Message 2 (Day 3, if no response):** Value-add
> "No worries if you're busy—I put together a quick resource on [solving their problem] that might help regardless. [Link to value piece]. Happy to chat if you're interested in the pilot program I mentioned."

**Message 3 (Day 7, if no response):** Direct ask
> "Last follow-up—I'm opening 5 pilot spots this week at 50% off. If [problem] is still a priority, let me know and I'll send details. If not, no worries at all."

### Handling Objections

**"I want to wait until it's finished."**
> "Totally understand. The tradeoff is: pilot members pay half price and get direct input on features. Once we launch, it'll be the regular price with standard support. Which matters more to you—having it polished, or paying less and getting it customized to your needs?"

**"The price is too high."**
> "I hear you. Quick question—if this saves you [X hours/week or $Y/month], would that change the math? [If yes, continue conversation. If no, they might not be the right customer.]"

**"I need to think about it."**
> "Of course. What would you need to know to make a decision? Happy to answer questions or send more info."

**"Can I try it free first?"**
> "We don't have a free trial yet, but we do have a guarantee: if you're not seeing results in [30 days], I'll refund your payment. That way you can try it risk-free."

### Pre-Sale Success Metrics

**Target:** 3-5 paying customers before building

| Conversations | Pre-Sales | Conversion | Interpretation |
|---------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 10 | 0 | 0% | Problem: offer, targeting, or idea |
| 10 | 1 | 10% | Promising—keep going |
| 10 | 2-3 | 20-30% | Strong validation—proceed to build |
| 10 | 4+ | 40%+ | Exceptional—scale immediately |

**Note:** These are conversations with qualified prospects who fit your ICP, not random outreach.

## Level 5: Concierge MVP

**Effort:** Very High (ongoing)
**Confidence:** Very High
**What you're testing:** Can you actually deliver value?

You have pre-paying customers. Now deliver manually before automating.

### What Is a Concierge MVP?

A Concierge MVP delivers your service through **manual human effort** rather than automated systems. You're the "automation"—at least temporarily.

**Why do this?**

1. **Learn deeply:** You'll understand edge cases, exceptions, and real customer needs that you'd never discover otherwise
2. **Iterate quickly:** Changing a process takes minutes; changing code takes hours/days
3. **Deliver immediately:** Customers get value now, not "when the product is ready"
4. **Reduce risk:** If the manual process doesn't work, you haven't wasted development time

### The Concierge Timeline

**Weeks 1-4: 100% Manual**
- Client submits requests via form/email
- You process manually (using Claude, spreadsheets, whatever works)
- You deliver results via email/Slack
- Focus: Learning the edge cases, refining the process

**Weeks 5-8: 50% Automated**
- Build automation for the common cases (80% of requests)
- Handle exceptions manually
- Test automation with real customer data
- Focus: Proving the automation works

**Weeks 9-12: 80% Automated**
- Automation handles most scenarios
- You monitor and intervene when needed
- Document remaining manual steps
- Focus: Scaling capacity

**Week 13+: Fully Automated**
- System runs with minimal intervention
- You focus on customer success and sales
- Take on more clients
- Focus: Growth

### What You'll Learn

The concierge phase reveals things no amount of research could:

**Customer behavior:**
- How do they actually submit requests?
- What format is their data in?
- What questions do they ask?
- What support do they need?

**Edge cases:**
- What exceptions occur?
- What breaks your assumptions?
- What requires human judgment?

**Value perception:**
- What results do they care about most?
- What features don't they use?
- What would make them pay more?

### Concierge Examples

**E-commerce: AI Product Descriptions**

*Manual process:*
1. Client sends product spreadsheet weekly
2. You use Claude to generate descriptions
3. You review and edit for brand voice
4. You send back formatted for their platform

*What you learn:*
- Their brand voice requirements
- Formatting needs for different platforms
- Edge cases (bundles, variants, etc.)
- Which products need the most attention

**SaaS: AI Customer Support**

*Manual process:*
1. Client forwards support emails to you
2. You draft responses using Claude
3. You review for accuracy
4. You send back to client (or send directly with their permission)

*What you learn:*
- Common question categories
- Tone expectations
- When to escalate vs. auto-respond
- Integration requirements with their helpdesk

### The Airbnb Example

Airbnb is the canonical example of Concierge MVP:

**What they did:**
1. Posted their apartment on Craigslist
2. Manually coordinated bookings via email
3. Took professional photos of listings themselves
4. Met with hosts personally to onboard them
5. Handled every customer service issue individually

**What they learned:**
- Professional photos dramatically increased bookings
- Trust/safety was the #1 concern
- Mobile experience mattered more than desktop
- Local experiences mattered as much as lodging

**Only after** validating demand and understanding the market did they build the technology platform.

**The lesson:** Manual operations give you insights that automated systems never could. Embrace the inefficiency—it's temporary, and the learning is permanent.

## Setting Success Metrics

Validation without metrics is just guessing. Define success before you start.

### The Metrics Hierarchy

Different metrics tell you different things:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    METRICS HIERARCHY                            │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Views** tell you reach (mostly vanity)
**Clicks** tell you interest
**Signups** tell you intent
**Pre-orders** tell you serious intent
**Revenue** tells you actual demand

### Benchmark Metrics by Channel

Different channels have different conversion expectations:

**Content → Email Signup:**

| Channel | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|---------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Blog post CTA | &lt;0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2%+ |
| YouTube video description | &lt;0.3% | 0.3-0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1%+ |
| Twitter/X bio link | &lt;0.1% | 0.1-0.3% | 0.3-0.5% | 0.5%+ |
| LinkedIn post link | &lt;0.2% | 0.2-0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1%+ |

**Ads → Landing Page:**

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Click-through rate (CTR) | &lt;0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2%+ |
| Landing page conversion | &lt;5% | 5-10% | 10-20% | 20%+ |
| Cost per signup | &gt;$10 | $5-10 | $2-5 | &lt;$2 |

**Email List → Sales:**

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Open rate | &lt;15% | 15-25% | 25-35% | 35%+ |
| Click rate | &lt;2% | 2-4% | 4-6% | 6%+ |
| Email → Purchase | &lt;0.5% | 0.5-1% | 1-2% | 2%+ |

**Outreach → Meetings:**

| Metric | Poor | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| Cold email response | &lt;2% | 2-5% | 5-10% | 10%+ |
| LinkedIn DM response | &lt;5% | 5-10% | 10-20% | 20%+ |
| Meeting → Pre-sale | &lt;10% | 10-20% | 20-30% | 30%+ |

### Setting Your Success Threshold

Before starting any validation activity, define:

**1. What constitutes success?**
Be specific: "If 10% of landing page visitors sign up for the waitlist within 2 weeks, we proceed."

**2. What constitutes failure?**
Be specific: "If fewer than 3% sign up after 500 visitors, we pivot our positioning."

**3. What's the minimum sample size?**
Don't make decisions on small numbers. Minimum 100-200 data points for most metrics.

**4. What's the timeframe?**
Give it enough time: 2-4 weeks for most smoke tests.

**Example validation plan:**

```text
VALIDATION PLAN: AI Customer Support for Shopify Stores

SMOKE TEST PHASE (2 weeks)
- Success: 12% email signup rate from 400+ visitors
- Failure: &lt;5% signup rate
- Sample: 400 visitors minimum
- Budget: $200 in ads

PRE-SALE PHASE (2 weeks)
- Success: 3+ pre-paying customers at $500/month
- Failure: 0 pre-sales after 20 qualified conversations
- Target: 20 sales conversations

GO/NO-GO: Proceed to build if both phases hit success metrics
```

## What the Data Tells You

Data is only useful if you know how to interpret it.

### Diagnosis Framework

When results aren't what you expected, diagnose the issue:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 DIAGNOSIS FRAMEWORK                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  LOW TRAFFIC + LOW CONVERSION                                   │
│  → Problem: Nobody sees your offer                              │
│  → Fix: Better distribution, different channels                 │
│                                                                 │
│  HIGH TRAFFIC + LOW CONVERSION                                  │
│  → Problem: Offer doesn't resonate                              │
│  → Fix: Improve messaging, pricing, or target audience          │
│                                                                 │
│  HIGH TRAFFIC + HIGH CONVERSION + NO SALES                      │
│  → Problem: Interest doesn't translate to purchase              │
│  → Fix: Price point, payment friction, or wrong audience        │
│                                                                 │
│  LOW TRAFFIC + HIGH CONVERSION                                  │
│  → Signal: Great offer, needs more distribution                 │
│  → Fix: Scale what's working, expand channels                   │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Common Failure Patterns

**Pattern 1: "Great feedback, no signups"**

*Symptom:* People tell you it's a great idea, but conversion is &lt;3%

*Diagnosis:* Your offer doesn't compel action. Either:
- The problem isn't urgent enough
- Your solution seems too good to be true
- Friction in the signup process
- Wrong audience (interested but not buyers)

*Fix:* Add urgency, reduce friction, improve credibility, narrow targeting

**Pattern 2: "Signups but no shows"**

*Symptom:* People signup but ghost on calls/trials

*Diagnosis:* The signup was low commitment. They're interested but not motivated enough.

*Fix:* Add friction intentionally (qualify harder), improve follow-up, make the commitment clearer upfront

**Pattern 3: "Conversations but no pre-sales"**

*Symptom:* People take calls, seem interested, then don't buy

*Diagnosis:* One of:
- Price too high for perceived value
- Not talking to decision makers
- Urgency isn't clear
- Competition is better positioned

*Fix:* Adjust pricing/packaging, qualify better before calls, create urgency, differentiate more clearly

**Pattern 4: "Pre-sales but churn immediately"**

*Symptom:* People buy but ask for refunds or cancel quickly

*Diagnosis:* Expectations weren't set correctly. Either:
- You oversold the solution
- The problem wasn't as urgent as they said
- The delivery didn't match the promise

*Fix:* Set clearer expectations, qualify harder, improve onboarding

### When to Pivot vs. Persist

This is the hardest judgment call in validation. Here's a framework:

**Pivot when:**
- Multiple validation levels fail
- Patterns suggest fundamental market issues
- You've tried 3+ significant changes with no improvement
- 20+ qualified conversations and 0 pre-sales
- The math doesn't work (CAC > LTV)

**Persist when:**
- One level fails but others succeed
- Failures are clearly fixable (bad landing page, wrong channel)
- Small changes show meaningful improvement
- A subset of audience responds strongly (niche down further)
- You're learning fast and see a path forward

**The 3-Strike Rule:**

Make 3 significant changes before pivoting:
1. Change your messaging/positioning
2. Change your target audience
3. Change your channel/distribution

If all three fail, then pivot. If any shows promise, iterate on that angle.

## Real-World Case Studies

Learn from companies that validated before building.

### Case Study 1: Dropbox (SaaS)

**The problem:** File syncing was painful and most people didn't know they needed it.

**The validation:**

Instead of building the product (which would take months of complex engineering), Drew Houston created a 3-minute video showing how Dropbox would work.

**The results:**
- Signups went from 5,000 → 75,000 overnight
- Validated demand before writing a single line of sync code
- Used the waitlist to prioritize features

**The lesson:** A video explaining your solution can validate demand faster than building the actual solution.

### Case Study 2: Buffer (SaaS)

**The problem:** Scheduling social media posts was tedious.

**The validation:**

Joel Gascoigne created a [landing page MVP](https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51) with just:
- A headline explaining the value prop
- A "Plans and Pricing" button
- Three pricing tiers

When people clicked "Plans and Pricing," they saw the prices. When they clicked a plan, they got a message: "We're not ready yet. Leave your email and we'll let you know when we launch."

**The results:**
- Validated that people would click through to pricing (interest)
- Validated which pricing tier had most interest
- Built an email list of engaged prospects

**The lesson:** You can validate pricing before you have a product.

### Case Study 3: Dollar Shave Club (E-commerce)

**The problem:** Razor blades were overpriced and buying them was annoying.

**The validation:**

Michael Dubin created a video explaining the subscription concept. Total cost: about $4,500.

**The results:**
- 12,000 orders in the first 48 hours
- Video went viral (27M+ views to date)
- Validated the entire business model before scaling operations

**The lesson:** A compelling story about the problem + solution can generate massive demand instantly.

### Case Study 4: Zapier (SaaS)

**The problem:** Moving data between apps required custom integrations.

**The validation:**

The founders didn't build an integration platform first. They:
1. Posted on forums and communities about the problem
2. Manually connected apps for early users
3. Built integrations one at a time based on actual demand
4. Only automated what they'd already proven manually

**The results:**
- Learned which integrations mattered most
- Built relationships with early power users
- Grew revenue before building complex infrastructure

**The lesson:** Be the integration before you build the integration.

### Case Study 5: Product Hunt (SaaS)

**The problem:** Discovering new tech products was scattered and noisy.

**The validation:**

Ryan Hoover didn't build a website. He started a simple email list using Linkydink (a tool for creating link lists).

**The process:**
1. Curated daily product finds
2. Sent email to small list
3. List grew through word-of-mouth
4. Only built the full site after proving demand

**The results:**
- Validated demand with zero code
- Built audience before building product
- Understood what users wanted from the community

**The lesson:** An email list can validate demand better than a product launch.

### Scoring Your Validation

**Total Green Flags:** ___
**Total Red Flags:** ___
**Net Score:** ___ (Green - Red)

| Net Score | Interpretation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| 10+ | Strong validation | Build with confidence |
| 5-9 | Promising, some concerns | Address red flags, then build |
| 1-4 | Mixed signals | More validation needed |
| 0 or negative | Weak validation | Pivot or significantly change approach |

### The Final Test: Would You Invest?

Before proceeding, ask yourself:

> "If a friend showed me this validation data and asked me to invest $50,000 in their idea, would I?"

If the answer is "no" or "I'd need to see more," you need to see more before investing your own time and money.

## Conclusion: Validation Is the Work

Most entrepreneurs think validation is what you do before the "real work" of building.

**They've got it backwards.**

Validation IS the real work. It's the most important work. Everything else—building, marketing, selling—is easier when you've validated properly.

The entrepreneurs who skip validation often build for 6-12 months, launch to crickets, and then spend another 6-12 months trying to find customers for something nobody wants.

The entrepreneurs who validate properly build faster, launch with paying customers waiting, and spend their energy scaling something that already works.

**The choice is yours:**
- Build something nobody wants in 6 months
- Or validate for 4-8 weeks and build something people are already paying for

## Your Next Steps

**1. Start with interviews (Level 2)**

If you haven't talked to at least 10 potential customers using the Mom Test framework, start there. Nothing replaces firsthand understanding of the problem.

**2. Build your landing page (Level 3)**

Create a simple landing page to test your messaging. Check out our [SaaS Landing Page Template](https://www.aipaths.academy/es/resources/003_saas-landing-template) for a ready-to-use starting point.

**3. Set your success metrics**

Before driving traffic, define what success and failure look like. Write it down. Commit to it.

**4. Run the smoke test**

Drive 300-500 visitors. Measure results honestly. Adjust based on data.

**5. Attempt pre-sales (Level 4)**

If your smoke test shows promise, reach out to your signups and warm network for pre-sales.

**6. Deliver manually first (Level 5)**

Once you have 3-5 pre-paying customers, deliver the service manually. Learn everything you can before building automation.
