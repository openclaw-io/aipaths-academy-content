title: "How to Optimize Your AI Agent Costs: 5 Strategies That Work"
description: "AI agent costs can spiral fast — but they don't have to. The difference between spending $30 and $300 per month isn't the tools you use, it's the architecture decisions you make. This guide covers the optimization strategies that actually work, ordered from least to most effort."

## How much an unoptimized agent can cost

An AI agent isn't a chatbot that responds once. It's a system that runs in loops: reads context, thinks, executes tools, reads results, thinks again, responds. Each cycle consumes tokens. A single agent session can easily burn 50-100K tokens. Multiply by dozens of daily sessions and you're looking at millions of tokens per month. Without optimization, costs of $200-500/month per agent are common.

## What you're actually paying for: cost breakdown

Input tokens: everything the model reads (system prompt, history, tool results, external data). Output tokens: everything the model generates (2-5x more expensive than input). Cached tokens: repeated system prompts that providers cache at 90% discount. Tool calls: each tool invocation adds input tokens (the call) and output (the result). Context window: longer conversations accumulate more tokens per message. Understanding this breakdown is the first step to optimization — you can't reduce what you can't measure.

## Model cost comparison

Not all models cost the same, and the price difference can be 50x between tiers. Economic tier (Haiku, GPT-4o mini, Gemini Flash): $0.15-1/MTok input, ideal for simple tasks. Standard tier (Sonnet, GPT-4o): $2.5-3/MTok input, the daily workhorse. Premium tier (Opus, o3): $5-15/MTok input, for complex reasoning only. The key insight: most agent tasks don't need premium models. The optimization is using the cheapest model that produces acceptable results for each specific task.

## How to reduce costs without losing quality

### 1. Model routing: the right model for each task

The most impactful strategy. Instead of using one model for everything, assign models by task complexity. Classification, formatting, simple responses → economic tier. Daily writing, analysis, standard work → standard tier. Architecture decisions, complex reasoning, planning → premium tier. In a well-configured multi-agent system, 70-80% of interactions can use economic/standard models, with only 20-30% needing premium. Result: same quality at a fraction of the cost. In OpenClaw, this is configured per-agent via the model setting, and can be changed dynamically per session.

### 2. Prompt engineering for costs

Most people waste tokens without knowing it. Three techniques: Well-written system prompts — a detailed AGENTS.md saves the model discovery tokens. Instead of the model asking and exploring, it already knows what to do. Fewer round-trips = fewer tokens. Conciseness instructions — "Respond in 3 sentences maximum" or "Don't repeat context" sounds simple but reduces output tokens 40-60%. Breaking large tasks into subtasks — instead of one 10K token prompt, break into subtasks with clean context. Each processes fewer tokens. Bonus: if one fails, you don't lose all the work. Reddit data point: one user went from $200/month to $80/month with these optimizations alone — without changing models or plans.

### 3. Prompt caching: the feature almost nobody uses

When you repeat the same system prompt across multiple requests, the provider caches those tokens and charges 90% less. This is CRITICAL for agents: an agent has the same system prompt in EVERY interaction. If your system prompt has 2,000 tokens and you make 100 requests/day, without cache you pay 200K input tokens. With cache, you pay 20K. How to activate: Anthropic does it automatically if the prompt prefix is identical. Put the static part (instructions, personality, rules) at the BEGINNING and the dynamic part (conversation context) at the end. This maximizes cache hit rate. Numbers: for an agent with 3,000-token system prompt receiving 50 messages/day, savings are ~$15-25/month from this feature alone.

### 4. Local models as complement

NOT as a replacement for cloud models, but as a COMPLEMENT to reduce costs. What local models CAN do well: classify incoming messages, format text, extract data from documents, answer predictable FAQs, basic tool calling (Qwen 3.5 demonstrated on M1 Pro), pre-process long context before sending the summary to an expensive model. What you should NOT do locally: complex reasoning, quality content generation, anything where errors have consequences. Minimum setup: Ollama + 7-9B parameter model on any machine with 8GB+ RAM. $0/month API cost, real cost: electricity (~$2-5/month) + setup time. Hybrid pattern: 60-70% of tasks to local, 30-40% to cloud. API cost reduction: 50-60%.

### 5. Spending limits and monitoring

The last line of defense. Set hard spending limits per agent so no single agent can runaway your costs. Monitor daily/weekly spending to catch anomalies early. Set alerts when approaching thresholds. In OpenClaw, spending limits are configurable per agent. The subscription vs API decision: if your monthly token usage amounts to less than the plan price, API is cheaper. If it amounts to more, the subscription is a better deal. The hybrid approach (most popular on Reddit): base subscription ($20) for personal interactive use + API with spending limits for agents and automations.

## Optimization checklist

Use this to evaluate your current setup: □ Is each agent/task using the cheapest model that works? (Strategy 1) □ Are your system prompts concise and complete? (Strategy 2) □ Are you leveraging prompt caching? (Strategy 3) □ Are there tasks you could move to local models? (Strategy 4) □ Do you have spending limits per agent? (Strategy 5) □ Do you monitor daily token consumption? □ Can you explain which model each agent uses and why? Each of these can be implemented incrementally. Start with model routing and prompt caching — those two alone typically cut costs 40-60%.
