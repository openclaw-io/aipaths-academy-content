If you're a developer tired of switching between browser tabs, losing AI conversations in closed windows, and feeling locked into a single AI provider, there's a better way.

This guide shows you how to build a flexible, powerful AI workflow using terminal-based AI tools and Obsidian as your knowledge hub. The best part? Your knowledge stays in portable markdown files that work with any tool, today or tomorrow.

This isn't theory. It's the exact system thousands of developers use daily to stay productive without vendor lock-in.

## Why Terminal AI Beats Browser-Based AI

Let's be honest: using AI in a browser is convenient, but it has serious limitations.

### The Problems with Browser-Based AI

**Context Loss:** Close that tab? Your conversation is gone. Sure, ChatGPT has history, but good luck finding that prompt you wrote three weeks ago when you need it.

**Tool Lock-In:** You're married to one provider. Want to switch from ChatGPT to Claude for a specific task? Start over.

**Workflow Friction:** Copy code from AI → paste into editor → copy error → paste back to AI. The constant context switching kills flow state.

**Limited Integration:** Your AI lives in a bubble. It can't easily access your files, terminal, or development environment.

### Terminal AI Changes Everything

**Persistent Context:** Every interaction is saved as markdown. Search, reference, and build on previous conversations months later.

**Tool Flexibility:** Use Claude Code for coding, Gemini CLI for research, OpenAI API for bulk tasks. Mix and match based on the job.

**Workflow Integration:** AI works alongside your terminal, editor, and files. No more copy-paste friction.

**Future-Proof:** Plain text markdown files work with any tool. Forever.

**Developer Speed:** Stay in your terminal where you already work. Commands beat clicking.

## The Stack: Terminal + Markdown + Obsidian

This workflow has three components that work together beautifully:

### 1. Terminal AI CLI Tools

These are command-line interfaces that let you interact with AI models directly from your terminal. You're not limited to one.

**Popular Options:**

- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official CLI for Claude with file access and project context
- **Gemini CLI**: Google's command-line interface for Gemini models
- **OpenAI CLI**: Direct API access for GPT models
- **Aider**: AI pair programming in your terminal
- **LLM (Simon Willison)**: Universal CLI for multiple AI providers

**The Flexibility Advantage:** Install multiple tools. Use Claude for code review, Gemini for research, OpenAI for batch tasks. You choose the right tool for each job.

### 2. Markdown Files: Your Knowledge Format

AI responses save as markdown files. This is the secret sauce.

**Why Markdown?**

- **Portable**: Works with any tool, any platform, forever
- **AI-Readable**: AI can easily parse and reference previous conversations
- **Git-Friendly**: Version control your AI interactions
- **Future-Proof**: Plain text never becomes obsolete
- **Searchable**: Grep, ripgrep, or any search tool works instantly

**Example Structure:**

```text
my-knowledge/
├── projects/
│   ├── webapp-architecture.md
│   └── database-design.md
├── research/
│   ├── terminal-ai-comparison.md
│   └── obsidian-plugins.md
└── daily-notes/
    ├── 2025-01-20.md
    └── 2025-01-24.md
```

### 3. Obsidian: Your Knowledge Interface

Obsidian is where the magic happens. It's not just a markdown editor - it's a complete knowledge management system.

**Why Obsidian?**

- **Works with local files**: Your markdown files stay on your system
- **Bidirectional linking**: Connect ideas across conversations
- **Graph view**: Visualize how your knowledge connects
- **Powerful search**: Find anything instantly
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Extend functionality infinitely
- **Mobile apps**: Access your knowledge anywhere
- **Completely free**: Core features cost nothing

**Obsidian doesn't lock you in.** Your files remain standard markdown. If Obsidian disappeared tomorrow, you'd still have all your knowledge in a format every tool understands.

## Setting Up Obsidian

Now let's set up Obsidian to make your markdown knowledge base powerful.

### Initial Setup

1. **Download Obsidian**: Visit [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and download for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

2. **Create a Vault**:
   - Open Obsidian
   - Click "Create new vault"
   - Point it to your `knowledge/` directory (where AI conversations save)
   - Obsidian now monitors this folder

3. **Enable Community Plugins**:
   - Settings → Community plugins
   - Turn off "Restricted mode"
   - Browse and install plugins

### Essential Plugins for Terminal AI Workflow

**Dataview** - Query your notes like a database

- Create dynamic lists and tables from your markdown files
- Filter and sort conversations by date, tags, or metadata
- Essential for organizing large knowledge bases

**Templater** - Create consistent note templates

- Automate frontmatter creation with dynamic values
- Set up templates for AI conversations, daily notes, and project docs
- Speeds up note creation significantly

**Obsidian Git** - Auto-commit your knowledge to Git

- Settings → Obsidian Git
- Set your repo path
- Enable auto-backup (every 30 minutes)
- Your AI conversations are now version controlled

**Quick Switcher++** - Lightning-fast file navigation

- Press `Ctrl/Cmd + O` to open any file instantly
- Search by content, not just filename
- Navigate your knowledge at thought speed

**Graph Analysis** - Visualize connections

- View → Open graph view
- See how conversations and ideas link together
- Discover unexpected patterns in your knowledge

### Obsidian Vault Structure

Here's a battle-tested structure:

```text
knowledge/
├── 00-inbox/              # New notes land here
├── 10-daily/              # Daily notes
├── 20-projects/           # Project-specific notes
├── 30-research/           # Research and learning
├── 40-snippets/           # Code snippets and prompts
├── 50-reference/          # Documentation and references
├── 60-archive/            # Completed or outdated notes
├── templates/             # Note templates
└── index.md               # Master index
```

**Why Numbers?** They enforce sort order and create a natural hierarchy.

**Pro Tip:** Use consistent frontmatter in each markdown file for better organization:

```markdown
---
created: 2025-01-24
tags: [terminal, ai, workflow]
type: research
model: claude-3-opus
---

# Terminal AI Setup Research

Your content here...
```

This makes files searchable and linkable in Obsidian.

### Linking and Tagging Strategy

**Use Wikilinks for Connections:**

```markdown
I asked [[Claude]] about [[dependency-injection]] in [[TypeScript]].

This connects to my earlier research on [[SOLID-principles]].
```

Obsidian automatically creates a graph of these connections.

**Use Tags for Categories:**

```markdown
#ai-conversation #terminal #workflow #tutorial
```

Then use Dataview to query:

```markdown
# All Terminal Workflow Notes
```dataview
LIST
FROM #terminal AND #workflow
```

### Search Tips

**Obsidian's search is powerful:**

```markdown
# Find all Claude conversations about TypeScript
path:ai-conversations "claude" "typescript"

# Find recent research notes
file:(research) created:7d

# Find notes with TODO items
tag:#ai-conversation /TODO/

# Combine filters
path:projects tag:#terminal -tag:#archived
```

## Conclusion

The terminal AI + Obsidian workflow isn't just about using AI tools. It's about building a knowledge system that:

- **Stays with you**: Portable markdown files work everywhere
- **Grows with you**: Link ideas across months and years
- **Adapts to you**: Choose the right AI tool for each task
- **Works for you**: Automation reduces friction
- **Belongs to you**: No vendor lock-in, ever

Browser-based AI is convenient. This workflow is sustainable.

You're not just asking questions and getting answers. You're building a second brain that makes you smarter over time.

Start small. Pick one AI CLI tool. Point Obsidian at a folder. Save one conversation as markdown. The system grows from there.
