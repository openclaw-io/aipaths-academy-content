## Decision 1: Own hardware or VPS/Cloud?

Own hardware (Mac Mini, PC, Raspberry Pi): one-time investment, full data control, no third-party dependency, you handle maintenance and electricity. Profile: values privacy, has stable internet, prefers paying once. VPS/Cloud: recurring monthly cost (from $4/month), fixed IP, guaranteed uptime (99.9%+), scalable, provider handles physical hardware. Profile: doesn't want hardware, needs fixed IP, or has unreliable home internet.

## Decision 2: If you chose hardware → Which hardware?

🥇 Mac Mini M4 — The top recommendation. Silent (no fan at idle), low power (5-10W), macOS stable, Apple Silicon excellent for Node.js. Base ($599): 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD — enough for cloud agents. 24GB ($799) if you want local models. Electricity: ~$1-3/month. It's literally what we use at AIPaths. 🥈 Raspberry Pi 5 — The minimum that works. $80-100 complete kit. 8GB RAM max — enough for cloud agents, NOT for local models. Low power (~5W). Limitation: ARM may have issues with some npm packages. 🥉 Your current laptop — To start (not to stay). $0 additional cost. Agent sleeps when laptop sleeps. Viable for testing, development, work-hours-only use.

## Decision 3: If you chose VPS → What type?

Budget VPS ($4-8/month): what most people need. 1-2 vCPU, 1-4GB RAM. Enough for OpenClaw + a few agents. Providers: Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Contabo. GPU VPS ($30-80/month): only if you run local models (Ollama). Not needed for cloud API agents. Managed cloud ($5-20/month): zero DevOps, services like Railway or Render. Easier but less control.

## Bonus decision: Local models or API?

If you only use APIs (Claude, GPT, Gemini): any option works. The heavy compute happens on the provider's cloud. Your machine just runs Node.js and maintains connections. If you want local models (Ollama): you need RAM. 7B params → 4-8GB RAM. 13B params → 8-16GB RAM. 30B+ params → 24-32GB+ RAM. Mac Mini with 24GB or PC with 32GB minimum. Hybrid approach (most popular): basic hardware for APIs + small local models (7-9B) for simple tasks.

## Your decision path: the summary

Own hardware → High budget: Mac Mini M4. Medium: recycled PC. Low: Raspberry Pi. Cloud → Budget VPS (Hetzner/DO) + Tailscale + hardening. Local models? → Need 24GB+ RAM. Our recommendation: Mac Mini M4 16GB for most people. It's what we use, it works, and the cost amortizes in ~6 months vs an equivalent VPS.

## FAQ — Real questions from our audience

"Can my API account get banned for using OpenClaw?" — No. The API is designed for programmatic use. Different from automating the web interface (which DOES violate TOS). "Can I use an old PC instead of buying a Mac Mini?" — Yes. Install Ubuntu Server, it works the same but noisier and more power-hungry. "Do I need a fixed IP or domain?" — Not necessarily. Tailscale gives you secure remote access without exposing ports. "How many agents can I run on a Mac Mini?" — With cloud APIs, dozens. The bottleneck is the API, not local hardware. "What happens if power or internet goes out?" — Agent loses connection, reconnects automatically when restored. For high availability, use a VPS. "Is it safe to give an AI agent access to desktop/files?" — Create a dedicated OS user, restrict permissions, use workspace-only mode. See our Security Guide. "Which Mac Mini model? Base or more RAM?" — Base 16GB for cloud agents. 24GB if you want local models.
