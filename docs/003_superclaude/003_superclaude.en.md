# SuperClaude Framework

SuperClaude is a meta-programming configuration framework that transforms Claude Code from a basic code editor into a structured development platform with intelligent agents and workflow automation capabilities.

## What is SuperClaude?

SuperClaude enhances Claude Code by injecting behavioral instructions and orchestrating specialized components. Instead of working with just a code editor, you get a complete system with:

- **Intelligent Agents**: 16 specialized agents handling domain-specific expertise
- **Workflow Automation**: Systematic task management and orchestration
- **Context Optimization**: Dramatically reduced token usage (up to 94% reduction)
- **Behavioral Modes**: 7 different modes that adapt to your workflow context

## Core Components

### Three Main Plugins

1. **PM Agent**
   - Confidence-driven orchestration
   - Task management with ≥90% confidence threshold
   - Intelligent decision-making for workflow routing

2. **Research Plugin**
   - Autonomous web search capabilities
   - Adaptive planning with multi-hop reasoning
   - Context-aware information gathering

3. **Index Plugin**
   - Context optimization engine
   - Achieves 94% token reduction (58K → 3K tokens)
   - Improves performance and context window efficiency

### 16 Specialized Agents

SuperClaude includes domain-specific agents for:
- Security engineering
- Frontend architecture
- Project management
- Backend development
- DevOps automation
- And more...

Each agent brings specialized knowledge and best practices to their domain.

### 7 Behavioral Modes

The framework adapts to different contexts with specialized modes:

- **Brainstorming**: Creative ideation and exploration
- **Business Analysis**: Requirements and strategic planning
- **Deep Research**: Thorough investigation and documentation
- **Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination
- **Token Efficiency**: Optimized context usage
- **Task Management**: Structured workflow execution
- **Introspection**: Self-analysis and improvement

### 8 MCP Servers

Enhanced capabilities through Model Context Protocol servers:
- **Tavily**: Advanced web search
- **Serena**: Memory and context persistence
- **Sequential**: Efficient reasoning chains
- Plus 5 additional specialized servers

## How It Works

SuperClaude uses **TypeScript plugins** with these key features:

- **Zero Installation**: Project-local auto-detection
- **Hot Reload**: Edit, save, and see changes instantly
- **Auto-Activation**: Triggers via SessionStart hook
- **Mature Codebase**: 298+ commits of active development

## Why Use SuperClaude?

### Context Window Efficiency

The Index Plugin can reduce your token usage by up to 94%, allowing you to:
- Work with larger projects
- Maintain longer conversations
- Keep more context available
- Improve overall performance

### Intelligent Orchestration

The PM Agent intelligently routes tasks to specialized agents based on:
- Task complexity and type
- Confidence levels (≥90% threshold)
- Available domain expertise
- Current workflow context

### Workflow Automation

SuperClaude automates repetitive development workflows:
- Research and documentation
- Security analysis
- Architecture planning
- Task coordination
